                <h2>Church Leadership</h2>
                <p>A body without a head is incomplete so is an organization without any form of leadership. 
                  The church's leadership is centered around the priest in charge, who presides over a Pastoral Council 
                  made up of members of the community. Their task is to ensure the smooth running of St Bakhita Catholic Church.</p>
