# 13TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME, YEAR B
Theme: That we may have life.

---

#### 1st Reading: Wisdom, chapter 1: 13-15, and chapter 2: 23-24

Scripture explains that God did not create spiritual death. He made us in his likeness; so that we could live forever like him. The devil causes spiritual death. He who is dead spiritually is cut off from God, the source of life.

#### 2nd Reading: 2 Corinthians, chapter 8: 7, 9, 13-15.

St. Paul says that since we excel in everything, such as faith and knowledge, we should also excel in charity because it pays to be generous.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 5: 21-43 or 21-24, 35b-43.

Jesus heals a bleeding woman and restores a girl to life. These miracles show, in a nutshell, the purpose of Jesusâ€™ coming: to restore our spiritual health and to give us eternal life.
