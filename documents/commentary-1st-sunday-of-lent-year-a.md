# 1ST SUNDAY OF LENT YEAR A
Theme: Temptation and sin

----

#### 1st Reading: Genesis chapter 2:7-9, and chapter 3:1-7

The story of the fall of Adam and Eve outlines the process we also go through when we fall into temptation. First, we weigh the options; then, all the same, we go ahead and succumb to temptation. We only become aware of our grave mistake when it is too late.

#### 2nd Reading: Paul’s letter to the Romans, chapter 5:12-19.

St. Paul assures the faithful that although mankind was condemned to sin and death by the action of Adam, we have been acquitted, discharged and granted the chance of life eternal through Christ’s sacrifice.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew chapter 4: 1-11

Jesus was tempted by the devil, with three very attractive offers. The Lord walked away from these temptations by standing firm on the word of God.
