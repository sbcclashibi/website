# 26TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR A
Theme: Responsibility

#### 1st Reading: Ezekiel, chapter 18: 25 - 28

This scripture underscores the fact that we are fully responsible for whatever happens to us. We cannot blame God or others for the fate that may await us as a result of our own choices.

#### 2nd Reading: Philippians, chapter 2: 1 - 11

St Paul appeals to us to be united in all things, and to show solidarity with each other all the time. We must imitate Christ whose exemplary life earned him Godâ€™s ultimate approval.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 21: 28 - 32

Jesus wants us, especially the self-righteous, to evaluate these two characters in our reading; the hypocrites who would not do as they promise, and the others who change their minds and do the right thing. It is up to us to take a stand.
