# SOLEMNITY OF SAINTS PETER AND PAUL, APOSTLES
Theme: Peter and Paul, examples to be followed

---

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 12: 1 – 11

We read a vivid account of Peter’s miraculous escape from prison. His affirmation of the Lord’s hand in his rescue must reinforce our belief in God’s protection for those who fear him. 

#### 2nd Reading: 2 Timothy, Chapter 4: 6 – 8, 17 – 18

Paul looks back on his life as an Apostle, a life that was full of hard work and persecution. He is confident of receiving his due reward, in as much as he looks forward to the continuous spreading of the Good News.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, Chapter 16: 13 – 19

Peter’s declaration of faith that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah, thrust him into the role of “Rock” on which Jesus built his church. Our confession of faith must, of necessity, lead us to the roles we should play in building the church.
