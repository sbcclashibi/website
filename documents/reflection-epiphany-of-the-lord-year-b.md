Today, we shall reflect on the Three Wise Men, or Women. 

Little Joe grew up in a village, where a priest would come to celebrate Mass once in three months. On those occasions, the Catholic faithful from nearby villages would gather together for the “zonal” Mass. 

Little Joe observed how the faithful suffered, trekking all the way to his village for Mass, once every three months. This set him thinking about how to solve the inconveniences that the faithful had to go through. He finally found a solution, which was to become a priest. Seven-year-old Joe shared his dream with his dad, telling the old man that he would like to be a priest and serve in his village. His dad gave him his blessing, and began to introduce him to the various prayers of the church.

Little joe went through his elementary school, and gained admission to a secondary school, and finally, into the seminary. During the first term vacation while in secondary school, an American Priest came to celebrate the “zonal” Mass, in English. Joe was asked to do the interpretation of the Mass into the local language. The celebration was the Epiphany of the Lord. Joe held his head in his hands (a sign of helplessness or utter confusion), wondering how exactly he was going to perform the impromptu task. Actually, he was not used to the American accent, and that seemed to complicate matters. To cut a long story short, Little Joe did the job well, to the admiration and satisfaction of the congregation.

“That Little Joe is Father Joe who is standing right before you this morning!”

The message in this story is that we need to study the bible. We need to know more about our faith, so we can shine. That is what we are called to do as Christians; we are called to arise and to shine wherever we are.

In the Gospel, we read that the Wise Men came and donated gifts to the Infant Jesus. They came; they gave; they returned to their homes. Parishioners of St. Bakhita have also sacrificed much, looking at the physical developments that have taken place since the last time Fr. Joe visited. On that score, St Bakhitans are wise men on account of their sacrifices for the good of the church, just like the Three Wise Men sacrificed their comfort to seek out the Infant Jesus, and presented him with the gifts.

The Three Wise Men did more than presenting gifts to the Lord: they spread the news about the new born king. St. Bakhitans have sacrificed, and continue to sacrifice. But that is not enough; there is more work to be done. We are called to go out and tell the story about the saviour. Let everyone know that you are a Bakhitan. Be like Little Joe who gave, and is still giving. Be like the Three Wise Men in the lives of others.
