Today is the 31st December, 2023. It is a day of double blessings: the last day of the year, and the Feast of the Holy Family. Be happy, because you are part of the living. It is the Feast of the Holy family. We can also make our families holy, but with conditions.

We can learn from Joseph, Mary and Jesus.

**Joseph**: What did he do? He was unwilling to put Mary to shame and disgrace.

A nobleman invited his friends to lunch in his home. After realizing that his wife had added too much salt to the food, he called her, loud enough for his friends to hear, to bring him the salt so he could salt the food himself. He later apologized to his friends for having made the food saltier than it should have been. By so doing, he saved his wife from disgrace and derogatory comments. 

The Josephs in this congregation must learn from this action by the nobleman. Your wife and children look up to you. Do not shame them. Do not disgrace them. Joseph obeyed the instructions of the angel, and did not disgrace his wife who was already with child.
Not only that: he sacrificed his personal comfort to flee with his wife and the child Jesus to Egypt. The rest of the family looks up to you the Josephs of the family. You are their compass. You cannot fail them. Issues may arise; like the truancy of children and many others. But be like Joseph.

**Mary**: Mary kept everything in her heart. My dear Marys in the house, keep everything in your heart. A sword may pierce your heart, but keep everything in your heart. Do not be the type of woman who would scream or shout at the top of her voice, for the whole neighbourhood to hear what is happening in your home. You must be the kind of mother your children would be looking forward to coming home to. Keep all your things in your heart, like treasure.

 When joseph and Mary finally found Jesus in the temple after he had been missing for three days, their interactions with him were very, very cordial. I am tempted to compared Mary’s reaction to what the typical Ghanaian woman would have done in similar circumstances: a knock, a slap a push and tonnes of scolding. Mary did not create a scene. She kept it all in her heart.

**Jesus**: Jesus was obedient and submissive to his parents. He grew in wisdom and in stature, and the favour of God was on him. The youth in the house, sometimes, know more than their parents. This is especially true when it comes to modern communication gadgets, and everything computer. Well, “What the elderly can sit and see, the young can jump but cannot see.” To put it into plain language, the elders have a lot of experience under their cloak.  Jesus was obedient and submissive. If you, our children could do same with our parents, wisdom would come from above to you. Respect and obey your parents

**Turn your family into Confessionals, not courtrooms**. In court, we argue, and argue. It is the best lawyer who wins the case. If we turn our homes into courtrooms, we will always argue, and argue. There would be chaos. But in the home, the Confessional, there is forgiveness, acceptance of faults and, above all, peace. Forgive one another, and move on. The home Confessional sets the tone for settling down to settle issues. 

**Do not enter 2024 with bitterness**. Stay together and fight your difficulties together. You may ask yourself: “For how long am I going to run away from these challenges?” When you face the problem together, you can resolve it together, just like Joseph and Mary did when they went looking for the “missing” Jesus. 
The Flight into Egypt was a challenge. but the Holy Family faced it. The pregnant virgin? They face this challenge, too. The complaints of your children can be faced by you and resolved by you.

**Invite Jesus into your family**. Jesus should not be left out of your family. A family that prays together stays together. Likewise, a family without Jesus is full of crises. A family without Jesus is full of Judas. It is only Jesus who can help solve our problems. Friends may offer advice, but their best efforts may mislead you. Invite him 2024. He will direct you. 

It is the last Sunday of the year, 2023; the Feast of the Holy Family. Make your family holy from today. The Holy Family will bless us, and illumine us with light. May the Holy Family bless us now and always.
