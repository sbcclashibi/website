Many of us have multiple (phone) lines, eg MoMo line, WhatsApp line and the main line, for calls. The most important line for the Christian is the Prayer Line. It is absolutely essential that we have a Prayer Line as the channel of communication between us and God.

Secondly, there should be an Upper Room in our homes. The truth is that we don’t have power of our own; we depend on the Holy Spirit.

In today’s 1st Reading, we read that the disciples, with some others and Mary, the mother of Christ, were gathered together in the Upper Room, and, with one accord, devoted themselves to prayer (Acts 1:14). Mind you, they were not gathered together passively, but were devoted to prayer.

From the Gospel Reading (John 17:1-11) also known as the Priestly Prayer of Jesus, we come to know that even Jesus, the Lord, prayed.

So why is it that we are not praying? Do you pray only at Mass? Another question might be: Are you at Mass passively?
Remember that praying on Sundays only is woefully inadequate. We should not be in the category of part-time Christians who are fighting a full-time devil. It won’t work!

Surely, God alone knows the plans he has for us: plans for prosperity….and not disaster etc (Jer. 29:11). This is great news. But all the same, the same God, in the next verse, Jer. 29:12, asks us to call (pray) to him and he will answer us.

So if our past efforts at prayer ended in stutters and splatters, we can confidently begin again. It is essential that we go back to a life of prayer, because prayer is a necessity for survival.
A prayerful you will enable you to re-echo the words of the Psalmist (Ps. 27:1-4, 13), that you are assured of God’s protection, and that you will live to see the Lord’s goodness...

St. Paul was immersed in prayer, and so urges us in Colossians 4:2 to “Be persistent in prayer, and keep alert as you pray, giving thanks to God.”
There’s nothing impossible; nothing too hard for God in an atmosphere of prayer.

Now, the Upper Room: the Upper Room! 

There’s the need for an Upper Room in your home, because many things/miracles happen in the Upper Room:
- Elisha raised the widow’s son back to life in the Upper Room (2 Kings 4: 8ff).
- Peter raised Tabitha back to life in the room upstairs (the Upper Room): see Acts 9:39-43.
- The disciples and the others, including Mary, mother of Christ waited prayerfully in the Upper Room to receive the Holy Spirit.

So, have a Prayer Line . Have an Upper Room.

And don’t forget: when you gather together to pray, the synergy is very powerful. You can’t prevail by flesh; but with prayer with others, there is power!

Activate your Prayer Line with God.
