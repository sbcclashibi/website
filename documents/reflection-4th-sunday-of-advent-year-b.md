Today’s Gospel Reading is about the Annunciation. We have heard it over and over. So, what is new? As Catholics, we celebrate this Solemnity year in, year out. So, what is new?

Today marks the end of the Season of Advent. For some of us, nothing has changed. We haven’t identified anything that shows that the year is ending, probably because our prayers have not been answered. And, because of that, the virtue of hope doesn’t resonate with us. Our marriage story has been the same, and there is no change in our other stories either. For some, there is no hope, so there is no disappointment. Their mantra seems to be “No hope, no disappointment.” For others, long term resolutions are no longer on the cards. So, we don’t hope; we don’t believe, and this situation has become more or less a survival strategy.

A young man wanted to marry a lady, but she showed no interest in the marriage proposal. Her feet dragging was because of some rather unpleasant personal experiences she had experienced. She saw how her mother had to undergo harsh widowhood rites when he dad passed on. She herself was subjected to the same rites when she lost her husband. Her fears were understandable and she wondered how she would be able to cope should the new man die and leave her a widow once again. Would her new story not be the same as the previous one?
Church reminds us that God is still active and moving. Your faith eyes will see him working smoothly and strongly. Don’t let Advent end without you renewing your prayer intentions to God.

In 2 Kings 5: 1-19, we read about Naaman, the Syrian army commander. He was highly honoured and respected; yet, he was confronted with the reality of leprosy. In the public space, he was powerful. He was “the man.” But in his private life, he carried the shame and burden of an infirmity.

We are like Naaman in several ways: publicly we are fine. In private, we suffer from addiction, drunkenness and other conditions that we cannot put out into the public domain. The servant girl in Naaman’s home, being conversant with her master’s predicament suggested to her mistress that her master could get a cure for his condition in Israel. You will wonder how a servant girl could be that bold to offer a suggestion in the house of a noble man. It was a matter of relationships. If her mistress had been cruel to her, the thought of seeing her master healed might not have crossed her mind. The Lord can easily use the person you don’t regard to bring a solution to your problems. 

In our Gospel Reading, the angel did not go to Jerusalem or to any of the big cities in Israel to deliver the Annunciation. He went to tiny, insignificant Nazareth, the place Nathanael questioned whether anything good could come from (John 1: 46).

Wherever you go, know that help can come from anywhere that God determines; it could be your house help or your lowly-placed subordinate. The answer you are looking for may come from that little place you regard as unimportant.

Let us recount the parable of the Ten Virgins (Matthew 25: 1-13). Five of the virgins were foolish because they did not carry extra oil for their lamps. Five were wise because they went prepared. Foolishness comes when we do not prepare for the future. The Five Foolish Virgins went to the dealers at midnight, to buy oil for their lamps. Midnight! The dealers were up doing business. But it was too late for the Five to get the oil they so badly needed. Their situation came about because they did not act early enough.

The height of foolishness is when we do not act early. If you plant a tree and intend pulling it out of the ground, you may do so quite easily when he tree is young. But if you wait till it is fully grown then it is impossible to pull it out of the ground. 

God has provided for us with countless opportunities. It is up to us to seek his help in good time. If you wait till your addiction is fully blown, it becomes very difficult to come out of it. Don’t wait for your marriage problems to escalate before you take corrective actions. Don’t wait till examinations are about to begin before you start studying.

We are at the end of Advent, and gradually getting to the end of the year. Something new can still happen. When we are open to the help God provides, we know that the merchants are always there. When we have eyes of faith, we can identify the help we need.
