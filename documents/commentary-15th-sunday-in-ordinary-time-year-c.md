# 15TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR C
Theme: Christian love guided by faith.

---

#### 1st Reading: Deuteronomy, Chapter 30: 10-14

Obeying Godâ€™s laws is not a difficult task. It is as easy as listening to the promptings of the Spirit of God, which is already in us.

#### 2nd Reading: Colossians, Chapter 1: 15-20

The divine nature of Christ is summed up in the fact that all things were made through him and for him. Jesus remains the centre of everything in heaven and on earth.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, Chapter 10: 25-37

The parable of the Good Samaritan teaches us that love of God cannot be separated from love of neighbour. We cannot say that we love God, and, at the same time, refuse to show concern for his children, our neighbours.
