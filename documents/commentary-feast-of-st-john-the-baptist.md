# SOLEMNITY OF THE BIRTH OF JOHN THE BAPTIST
Theme: Real greatness

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, Chapter 49:1-6

Our call to discipleship, or greatness for that matter, begins even before our birth. God equips us for the job, and though we may feel inadequate, he assures us of our reward because we remain a beacon of hope to the nations.

#### 2nd Reading: Acts, Chapter 13: 22-26

Paul draws on the reverence of King David by the Hebrews, and compares that to Jesus, the Messiah. The role of John the Baptist in the scheme of things is that of fore-runner to the King of kings.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 1:57-66, 80

The events of the day when John the Baptist was named confirm the greatness God placed on the child even before his birth.
