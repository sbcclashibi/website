# THE TRIUMPH OF THE HOLY CROSS YEAR C
Theme: We should glory in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ 

---

#### 1st Reading: Numbers, Chapter 21: 4a-9 

The Israelites were bitten by poisonous snakes because of their short memory of God’s power, as well as their complaining attitude. Yet God provided an antidote through their obedience to his instruction to look up at the bronze serpent. 

#### 2nd Reading: Philippians, Chapter 2: 6-11 

Jesus Christ humbled himself, and so God gave him a name high above every other person, so that we all may look upon him as the Lord! 

#### Gospel Reading: John, Chapter 3: 13-17 

Jesus refers to the healing that came to the Jews when they looked upon the bronze serpent lifted, and draws similarities between that event and our salvation from sin, which can only come when we look up, in faith, to him crucified.
