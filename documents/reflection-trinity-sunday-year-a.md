1.	The Trinity is the expression of God’s love to humanity. All three persons in the Trinity share the same substance, which is difficult to understand in terms of human arithmetic. They are distinct persons who are not an element of separation.
2.	Again, in the mystery of the Trinity, God is seen as a community; a community is composed of people of diverse cultures, traditions etc, who are brought together to form one community.
3.	There is one God, the creator, who expresses himself to us in three undivided forms: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, because he wants to get close to us, his children.
4.	The one God is a father to us who are always stubborn: stubborn in his eyes, and stubborn to ourselves, as we, more often than not, don’t keep the promises we make to ourselves, neither do we live up to our own expectations.
5.	But God made a promise to us, which he fulfilled by sending his Son, to bring us to himself.
6.	In Jesus, the son, the second person in the Trinity, we have the experience of God, the father, who wants to relate to us, as brother. Our stubbornness moved the son to pity for us, when he wept over Jerusalem, and in the Garden of Gethsemane. The son, therefore, gives us an example of pain when he uttered these immortal words: “…let your will be done.”
7.	Thus this relationship between the father and the son demonstrates the reality of how to live in love and in pain. 
8.	When things get tough for us, Christians, we must turn to the Son. Note that in the Trinity, the Father did not abandon the Son.
9.	To sustain us, Jesus, the Son promised to send us the Spirit, who is the link that exists between the Father and the Son, indeed, the bonding force of the Trinity.
10.	There is no need to argue about this mystery. In the Trinity, you, the believer, have God who is your father, God who is your brother, and God, the Spirit, who sustains you.
