#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles: Chapter 13: 14, 43-52

The joy of Paul and Barnabas, as they won more souls for Christ, was followed by persecution and expulsion by the powers that were. The fact that their converts remained joyful in the face of all these challenges should encourage us to persevere in trials.

#### 2nd Reading: Revelation, Chapter 7: 9, 14b-17

The crowd that was standing before the throne of the Lord attained sainthood after having gone through a period of trials. Their testimony is a lesson in how to remain steadfast in the Lord.

#### Gospel Reading: John, Chapter 10: 27-30

Jesus, the Good Shepherd, knows us thoroughly. This scripture affirms that he will not allow evil to befall his followers.
