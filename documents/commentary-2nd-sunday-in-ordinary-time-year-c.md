# 2ND SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME, YEAR C
Theme: For the Lord delights in you.

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 62: 1-5

God loves us in such an extraordinary way that he will do everything to prevent us from coming to any harm. We shall experience the goodness of the Lord, in his extra tender and loving care for us.

#### 2nd Reading: 1st letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 12: 4-11

God gives his Spirit to each person according to his own will for us. What we need to understand is that the different gifts that we exhibit come from the same Spirit.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 2: 1-11

Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding at Canaan. By turning water into the choicest wine, a miracle which, no doubt astounds us even today, Jesus invites us to know him as the God who is closer to us than we think.
