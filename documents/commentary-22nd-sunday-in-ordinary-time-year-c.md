# 22ND SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR C
Theme: He who humbles himself shall be exalted

---

#### 1st Reading: Sirach, Chapter 3: 17-18, 20, 28-29

Scripture explains that a humble person is appreciated by God, our Creator, and is highly regarded by his fellow men.

#### 2nd Reading: Hebrews, Chapter 12: 18-19, 22-24a

In contrast to the old perceptions about the manifestations of God’s greatness, it is soothing for followers of Christ to know that the God we worship is as approachable as he is affable.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, Chapter 14:1, 7-14

This scripture is as much a lesson in good social behaviour, with regard to self-esteem, as it is a caution about the need to be humble in order to attain a place of honour at the Lord’s banquet.
