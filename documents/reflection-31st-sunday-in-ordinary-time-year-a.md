It's all about leadership: parents, Scribes, Pharisees, in fact, all of us. The homily has lessons for each and every one of us.

#### 1. Don't be an ungrateful person.

A man was travelling in the desert. The sun was scorching, and his feet hurt from the hot sand. He saw,a tree in the distance, and dragged himself to its comforting shade. When he had rested, he looked up the tree for fruits. He found none, and unhesitatingly pronounced the tree a useless tree. The tree was angry, and reminded the traveller about what he had just enjoyed from it. He ordered the man away from him, and back to the harsh desert.

In our 1st Reading, we read that God was angry with the people of Israel. He had brought them out of exile, and had provided for their comfort. They were now living lives that displeased God. God was even ready to curse them.

We have attained our current positions or statuses because others helped us on the way: parents who patiently nurtured us, friends on whom we leaned and bosses who gave us the opportunity to hold a job.

But human as we are, we easily forget what they did for us. Even when we are reminded about these good deeds, we get angry and utter all manner of words.

God has done enough for us. Show him gratitude; don't push your God aside. Appreciate the fact that others helped you on your way up.

There is this story making the rounds on social media about a young boy who says that God has done nothing for him, and that everything that he enjoys is provided by his mother. Words like these should never proceed from the mouth of a believer. Even if God has done nothing for you, he has given you breath.

The priests in our 1st Reading were also guilty of offering blemished animals for the sacrifice, contrary to God’s instructions. What are you offering to God? We, today, are fond of dropping the filthiest currency notes into the collection box. Sure! God deserves better. Let's show him respect and gratitude. 

#### 2. Don't be a Scribe-Pharisee leader.

Jesus gave a beautiful description of this kind of leader in our Gospel Reading.it is like he is talking about our priests: their long robes, we greet them obsequiously, we offer them nice places in gatherings, we acknowledge them wherever they go, etc. 

Let us expand the priesthood beyond the ordained priests. You and I belong to the common priesthood by our baptism. The cap fits all of us: parents, bosses, older siblings etc. Like the Scribe-Pharisee leaders, we always want to be seen as “somebody.” We tend to issue commands which must be obeyed without question. We do not tolerate even simple questions that seek clarification of the command so it could be carried out. Is it because we, ourselves, cannot explain the commands?

Whatever you, the leader say, same shall you do. Your life must reflect your talk.

#### 3. Learn to be a Servant-Leader.

 St. Paul writes in 1 Thessalonians 2: 7: “We were gentle among you, like a nurse taking care of her children. So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the Gospel of God but also our own selves...”

This statement aptly describes a Servant-Leader. It describes the kind of leader St. Paul was: a Servant-Leader. We can look at a few Laws of the Catholic Youth Organisation (CYO), as they relate to servant leadership:

- A Servant-Leader is honest. He is clean. He does not hide anything from his followers.

- He is always there for his people, even in awkward times. That is why our priests are, at all times, in “servant mode.” And that is why you, a parent, cannot roll yourself up in bedclothes and catch a little more sleep when your child needs your attention.

- A servant-Leader is kind and helpful. When his people are in need, he is available to offer any form of assistance.

- He sets a good example. He does not say one thing and does the other. 

- He always wants to serve, and not to be served. This is the high point in our 2nd Reading.

So, my brother, my sister, from today, strive to be a Servant-Leader; to all your children, your friends etc. And remember to give the best part of everything to God.
