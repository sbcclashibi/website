# 4TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: He speaks with authority

#### 1st Reading: Deuteronomy, chapter 18: 15 – 20

God’s response to his people’s request for an intermediary was the promise of a prophet. The other issue to this covenant is that the prophet shall speak God’s word in its pure form, and that the people were obliged to listen to him.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, chapter 7: 32 – 35

St Paul urges caution in the choices that we make. Our decision to opt for one thing rather than the other, for example marriage or otherwise, must be guided by our desire to live for the Lord, and not to have divided attention.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 1: 21 – 28

Jesus’ words and actions contrast sharply with the posture of the religious leaders of his day. Through God’s word, the contemporary follower of Christ benefits from the authority with which Christ instructs us.
