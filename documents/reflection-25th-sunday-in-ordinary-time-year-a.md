#### Theme: God’s ways are not our ways. 

God himself declares in Isaiah 55:8 that his thoughts are not like ours, and that his ways are different from ours.

Several factors contribute to one’s way of doing things, and this is borne out by the fact that even among us, humans, there is a remarkable difference between the way two persons with similar skills execute their jobs.

#### Knowledge
Picture a teacher, with his deep knowledge of sanitation and good hygiene practices, taking up an appointment in a village where the source of drinking water is a stream teeming with all manner of debris. He would, first, strain the water and boil it before drinking it. Not so the townsfolk. They would wonder what is wrong with the newcomer whose only “fault” is that knowledge determined how he treated the water before using it. 

Likewise, God’s knowledge is supremely above ours. With such absolute knowledge, his ways of doing things are different from ours. Our knowledge is limited, and that is what we have to keep in mind.

#### Wisdom
This is the ability to make the right decisions based on your knowledge. God’s knowledge is supreme. He is all-knowing, and all-wise. Unlike human beings, God does not need to learn from experience. He knows how things work out. 

St. Paul combines God’s knowledge and wisdom when he penned the lines; “Oh, how deep are his wisdom and knowledge! Who can explain his decisions? Who can understand his ways?....” (Romans 11: 33-36). Therefore, my brother, my sister, submit to God, and surrender your way to his way, because “To him who by means of his power working in us is able to do so much more than we can ever ask for, or even think of….” (Ephesians 3: 20-21).

#### The depth of our love.
Consider what a mother, whose child is sick, would do to get the child healed. The same mother would not act with the same haste if she hears, in passing, that a stranger had fallen sick. 

God’s love for us is infinite. It surpasses ours. He is passionate about us; so his ways are totally different from ours. And so he loved the world so much so that he sent his only begotten son to die for our sins, so that we might have eternal life (John 3: 16). That is the depth of God’s love. God did not send his son to die for his own benefit, but for ours. (See also Romans 8: 28, Roman 8: 31-32).

#### Generosity
Our sense of generosity determines how we do things. We can compare and contrast how two bosses rewarded their reliable drivers. One built a house for the dedicated driver when he was leaving his service on attaining the age for retirement. The other boss compensated his driver according to the letter and spirit of the conditions of service governing his employees. Two bosses, to different senses of generosity.   

The question is: “Whose generosity is bigger than God’s? In today’s Gospel Reading, (Matthew 20: 1-16), the workers were paid the same amount irrespective of when they were engaged. 

Heaven is the same reward for all of us, whether we started off early or late. The thief who was crucified with Jesus might have lived a life of crime throughout his life, but in a twinkle of an eye, he was rewarded with a safe passage to heaven (Luke 23: 42-43). Peter and the apostles journeyed with Jesus. St. Paul went through a lot on his missionary journeys. Yet the same reward, heaven, is their prize.

None of us has the right by our own merit, to go to heaven. The Cross is the key to paradise. The one who can open the door for us is God, whose knowledge, wisdom, love and generosity cannot be matched.
