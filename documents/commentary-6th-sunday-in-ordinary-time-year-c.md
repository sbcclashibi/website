# 6TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME, YEAR C
Theme: Search for happiness

---

#### 1st Reading: Jeremiah, chapter 17: 5-8

Scripture teaches that it is far better to place our trust in God, and experience his joy and happiness, than to trust in human beings, and reap frustration, loneliness and emptiness.

#### 2nd Reading: 1st letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 15: 12, 16-20

The Christian faith is based on the philosophy and evidence of the Resurrection. Christian hope, therefore, extends into life after death.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 6: 17, 20-26

The Beatitudes uplift those who are at the receiving end of the unpleasant things of this life, and reserve all that is good and joyful to a life in eternity. The Christiansâ€™ hope for a better tomorrow therefore lies in the search for happiness through Christ-like attitudes.
