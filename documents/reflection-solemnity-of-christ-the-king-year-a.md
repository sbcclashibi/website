Today, we celebrate Jesus, who is King; Jesus who has a kingdom. The kingdom of a king is territory. It is also a reign. 

Unlike earthly kings who have jurisdiction over clearly defined areas, the kingdom of Christ and his reign are not limited by time. Nobody reigns forever, except the one who lives forever. In Isaiah 1: 1-5, we read that King Uzziah, an earthly king, or a mortal man, died. Not so our God who makes the determinants of time. He precedes all that he created. This means that if our God made time, he certainly existed before time. He exists outside time. Isaiah, the prophet, in the year of the king’s death, saw the Lord, seated on his throne. He had been seated on the throne, and continues to do so through all ages. 

For us Christians, our king is always (the party) in power forever. It is easy for us to talk about territorial limits, like the borders between countries or kingdoms. It is equally easy for us to know that there are no limits to the kingdom of our God. That is why we cannot talk about Christ being the king of the world, but the king of the universe. 

All authority in heaven and on earth have been given to Christ, our king (Hebrews 2: 8). He has been given power over everything, including kings and their kingdoms. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were thrown into the fiery furnace. They did not get burnt in the furnace, because it was cool in there. Read what happened to those outside the furnace, those who came close to it. They were burned. Charred. The king, Nebuchadnezzar saw what was going on and exclaimed that he could see someone like the Son of Man in the furnace with the three young Hebrew men. “Son of Man” is attributed to Jesus Christ whom we celebrate today. 

Jesus raised the widow’s son from the dead. he raised Lazarus too from the dead. He has authority over what we fear most: death, so that he would die and rise again. 

His kingdom is not subjugated to any other. You cannot subject the kingdom of Christ to any human law.

In Genesis 22: 16, we see how God swore by his own name. There is none beyond him, so he could not swear by anything else. He hardened the heart of Pharaoh (Exodus 9:12). A king who can harden the heart of another king is the real boss. Cast your mind back to when Jesus was brought before Pilate (John 19:11). Jesus, the one on trial, didn’t mince words when he emphatically told Pilate that he, Pilate, had no authority over him. Now, tell me: who is the boss here? 

Our king provides for us. 

Anybody can do anything for you, but would not do it the way God would. We can expand on this statement by drawing analogies from today’s responsorial Psalm.

- The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He is all sufficient.

- He makes me to lie down in green pastures: Signs of abundance.

- He leads me beside the still waters: Peace and serenity.

- He lays a table before me in the presence of my enemies: Your enemies must live so they can see your success. Don’t pray for the death of your enemies; they should live and see how the Lord, your king, is providing for you.

- My cup overflows: What God provides comes in “overabundance.” 

- He leads me through the paths of righteousness: That is testimony of how much our king loves us; steering us away from the kind of trouble that would lead us to eternal damnation.

- Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death: Absolute protection. There are times when things are really difficult, or as we say, “impossible.” Our king is around us.

- I fear no evil: Because your king is with you. He is beside you. In fact, you are in his presence, so do be not afraid. No fight is beyond him.

- Your rod and your staff, they comfort me: He uses the rod and staff to pull us back to himself when we are getting lost, in the same way a shepherd uses these accessories to pull back the sheep that are going astray.

- You anoint my head with oil: The oil makes you holy. Also it makes a wrestler slippery, such that his opponent cannot get a good grip on him. May God do it for you too so your enemy cannot hold or handle you.

- Goodness and mercy shall follow me: That is our prayer. But after that, there will be judgement. We shall be judged by what we do for the least of our brothers. Christ, the King, patiently explains this scripture in today’s Gospel Reading (Matthew 25: 31-46).

Jesus Christ is king forever!
