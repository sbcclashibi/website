# 3RD SUNDAY OF LENT YEAR A
Theme: Is the Lord in our midst or not?

---

#### 1st Reading: Exodus, chapter 17:3-7

God’s people tested the Lord by bickering, and through acts of impatience. By giving them water from the rock, God is telling us that he certainly is in our midst, providing us our requirements even through seemingly impossible channels.

#### 2nd Reading: Paul’s letter to the Romans, chapter 5: 1-2, 5-8

God’s love for us is so amazing that he gave us the grace of salvation through Christ, even at a time when we were deep in sin.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 4: 5-42

The Samaritan woman’s encounter with Jesus at the well teaches us several lessons, such as acknowledging Jesus as the source of life-giving water for our souls; the importance of attitude in our worship; and the necessity of regarding doing God’s work as sufficient food for our journey.
