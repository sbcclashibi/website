#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 60:1–6

Jerusalem is portrayed as the city to which all the nations of the earth shall converge.  Jerusalem shall be their destination because God’s own light shines forth from it.

#### Ephesians, chapter 3: 2–3, 5–6

The long-kept secret of God is that non-Jews shall, through the light of Christ, become joint heirs with the Jews, because we all share a common Christ-based destiny.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 2: 1–12

The Three Wise Men followed the light of the Star, and found Jesus.  It is our turn, dear Brother and Sisters, to follow the light of Jesus, with thankful gifts from our hearts.
