# 14TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: The Priest’s ministry.

--- 

#### 1st Reading: Ezekiel, chapter 2: 2-5

God sent Ezekiel to preach to a rebellious Israel. He encourages the prophet, and all priests, for that matter, that in spite of the people’s stubbornness, the Word of God will make an impact on them.

#### 2nd Reading: 2 Corinthians, chapter 12: 7-10

St Paul does not think highly of himself; instead, he is content to portray himself as a weak vessel that God is using for his purpose. He invites us to see in him the Christ whom he preaches.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 6: 1-6

Jesus’ own people failed to appreciate his ministry, and so did not benefit from his miracles. We also stand the chance of missing out on divine insights if we do not acknowledge those whom the Lord has anointed to be our shepherds.
