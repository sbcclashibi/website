Theme: Do we know Jesus Christ?

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 49: 3, 5 – 6

God speaks about his servant, through whom he would show his glory and bring the message of salvation to all nations.

#### 2nd Reading: The first letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 1: 1 – 3

St Paul’s greetings to all followers of Christ contain the reminder that we have been sanctified in Christ and have therefore been called to righteousness.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 1: 29 – 34

John the Baptist, after his encounter with Christ, testifies that Jesus is the great one who is to come, the one whom he had been preaching about. Our worship of Christ must give meaning John’s testimony.
