# 17TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: The hand of the Lord feeds us.

--- 

#### 1st Reading: 2 Kings, chapter 4: 42-44

Elisha supports his order that his people be fed with what seems to be a small quantity of food, with God’s assurance that the food would be more than adequate for their needs.

#### 2nd Reading: Ephesians, chapter 4: 1-6

Paul calls on the church to maintain and preserve its members’ unity by living such attributes as humility and patience, because it is the Spirit of the one God who is in all of us.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 6: 1-15

Jesus feeds a crowd of five thousand men from the same stock of five loaves and some fish. The symbolism for us today is that of the faithful feeding on Christ's one body and blood, in the Eucharist.
