God’s word invites us to search for, and to return to our merciful Creator, now that he has given us the opportunity to do so.

#### 2nd Reading: Philippians, chapter 1: 20c - 24, 27a

For St Paul, and for all Christians as well, “Life is Christ”, because in living, we should be working diligently for Christ, and, so that in death, we would be with Christ.
