The Knights of St. John International is a Roman Catholic men’s fraternal organization under the patronage of St John the Baptist. Its purposes include fostering unity and spiritual growth among members, supporting families during sickness or bereavement and assisting the Catholic Church.

The Order is also active in charity, community service and championing church-related initiatives at the local, diocesan and national levels.

#### A Brief History of the Order

It traces its institutional roots to a group of American Catholics who formally established the Ancient and Noble Order of the Knights of St John in New York, on the 6th of May 1886. Since 1992, the name of the organisation was changed to “The Knights of St. John International” to reflect its global expansion.

The Order was introduced into the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) in 1933 at Saltpond. Anthony Quansah, a shipping clerk working at the Takoradi Port was introduced to the Order by an expatriate officer. Together with his father, Emmanuel Raphael Quansah and other interested men, they applied to the Supreme Commandery for approval to begin a local commandery in Saltpond. With the permission of Thomas William Porter, then Archbishop of Cape Coast, the charter for St John the Baptist Commandery No. 346 was inaugurated in 1937 with Emmanuel Quansah serving as its first president.

The first commandery to be inaugurated in Accra was the Sacred Heart Commandery No. 351 on May 27th 1944. The ceremony was conducted by Emmanuel Quansah, with authorization from Msgr Noser, who would later become the Bishop of Accra.

When the organisation transitioned to a more international structure in 1992, Ghana was designated as a Supreme Subordinate Commandery, and Maj. Gen. JW Biney became the first president of this Ghanaian jurisdiction. Today, the KSJI in Ghana oversees ten Grand Commanderies across different parts of the country.

#### The Knights and Ladies at St Bakhita

The St Bakhita Commandery (No. 846)  and Ladies Auxiliary (No. 723) received their charters on the 4th of July 2015. This year they celebrated their 10th anniversary by donating pews at the church grotto. They also paid a charitable visit to the Sisters of Charity at Ashaiman.

Together with other knights and ladies from Tema, who comprise the 5th District commandery and District 2 ladies auxiliary, they interacted with final year students at the Mepe R/C school and donated school supplies to help them prepare for the 2025 BECE. They made a handsome donation to the school’s caretaker church, St Martin de Porres, at Ada.

The knights and ladies of St Bakhita Parish also support a cadet commandery and junior auxiliary, comprising children and teenagers who are brought up in the faith and discipline the order promotes. They actively support their education, spiritual growth and participation and leadership in church activities.

Each year at Easter, the Order at St Bakhita organizes charitable donations to the priests and other religious that serve our parish, as well as other persons or institutions within the church and Lashibi who are in need.
