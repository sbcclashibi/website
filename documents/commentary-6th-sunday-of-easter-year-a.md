#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles, chapter 8: 5 – 8, 14 – 17

The Samaritans accepted the Good News, and were received into the Christian fellowship. This proves that the Holy Spirit can, and, indeed, unites people from all cultures, into the one Body of Christ.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Peter, chapter 3: 15 – 18

A life in the Spirit of God often attracts jeers and cynicism. Peter urges the believer to remain resolute, and to respond appropriately and fearlessly.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 14: 15 – 21

Jesus promises his eternal presence, through the Holy Spirit, to all who love him and obey his word. To such as these would Christ show himself.
