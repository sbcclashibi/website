The 3rd Sunday of Advent is the Gaudete Sunday, or, the Rejoice Sunday. We rejoice in anticipation of what we are going to receive; that which gives us joy. Let’s take as an example a child waiting for the mum to finish preparing the meal. He hasn’t seen the food, yet, but he is joyful that the food will indeed be ready for eating. So, we rejoice that something good is going to come out of Bethlehem, the House of Bread.

In our 2nd Reading, we are invited to rejoice always. (1 Thess. 5: 16ff). Also, in Philippians 4: 4, we are called to rejoice in the Lord always. The command for the Christian is to rejoice. Intense joy must fill your soul. The command to rejoice is not conditional. Always, even in bad circumstances, we must rejoice.

We read in Acts 16: 25, how Paul and Silas, though in prison, broke into a session of praise and rejoicing to the amazement of the other inmates. We also know of the story about the three Hebrew lads who were thrown into the fiery furnace. They were rejoicing right inside the hot furnace. Furthermore, we find encouraging words in Habakkuk 3: 17-19 that even though the fig tree may not bear fruit, and the crops may fail, yet will be joyful and glad.

Joy comes along with peace and fortitude. There are five ways you can prolong your joy (from Fr. Hillary’s personal meditation).

#### Check your source of joy. 

That which abides gives joy that abides. If the source is not sustainable, your joy will be cut off. For example, if money in your pocket gives you joy, your countenance lights up. When the pocket is dry, it even shows on your face. You love your property, and you rejoice in it. You lose it, you’re inconsolable. If you put your trust in human beings, disappointments are your lot. To bring it further home, just lose your mobile phone; the world literally crashes down on your life. Or, you crash out of this world. 

You may want to take a few lessons from the stoics: Don’t be attached to anything in this world. Your attachment to a thing is that which gives you joy. When it is gone, there goes your joy.

The rule is that, that which is permanent gives permanent joy. Your joy must come from Jesus; he has lived, he is living and he will come again. Be assured that your joy will be forever, just like the kind of joy Mother Mary expressed in the Magnificat.

#### Contentment perpetuates joy.

No one can take your joy from you if you are content. Imagine chasing everything; and you are still not satisfied. It is like the man who has so much money that some is tied around his waist. He is walking gradually to his grave, yet he is not satisfied; he is still chasing money. 

Many people gather, and gather, and yet are not satisfied. If you’re not satisfied, know that you are postponing your joy. It’s wise to “stop small,” and “enjoy your joy small.” The point is that if you are not content, the frustration will kill your joy; your joy will be stolen from you.

Learn to count your blessings. Sit down and reflect on your life. Don’t steal glances at your neighbour’s possessions. Be content with yours, and be thankful to the Lord for what you have. The happiest people do not necessarily have the best of everything. They make the best of everything they have. If the desirable is not available, make the available desirable. Don’t you think it would be a good idea if your song is “I will greatly exult in my God; for he has clothed me in garments of salvation? (Isaiah 61: 10-11). 

#### Expectant faith and hope in God sustains joy.

This is the kind of expectation that doesn’t disappoint.

Let’s say you are eager to marry. You are counting and recounting your age. Nothing is happening. You want something done rather urgently, by your timelines. Things may not happen the way you want. No problem: God is always right. In 1 Samuel 1: 17-18, we read how Hannah’s expectations brought her extreme joy, after she heard the reassuring words from Eli, the priest. This was a woman whose womb God had closed (1 Samuel 1: 5). Hannah went on her way no longer depressed, but full of joy. It was not her fault that she couldn’t bear children. The timing belongs to God. Again, in Romans 8: 28, the Good Book tells us that all things work together for our good. So it was for Hannah; so it is for us today. For so long as you are in the hands of the Lord, everything shall turn out well. When you are expectant, you will learn patience. God knows best. Place your trust in his time. He knows what is best for you.

#### Bitterness is a joy stealer.

Forgiveness protects and protracts joy. The heaviness you feel when you have bitterness in your heart is a load. It is funny how you feel happy when you are carrying this kind of load! When you forgive, you feel light. There is no doubt about it. Sacrifice your bitterness for the joy that forgiveness brings. Life is short. Don’t spent the little time you have on bitterness. Bitterness corrodes. Forgive, and be kind. When you are kind, you are happy. You already know the soothing feeling you get when you do a proper Confession.

#### Fulfilling your purpose is fulfilling and sustaining joy.

In our Gospel Reading, John the Baptist replies his enquirers that he is not the Christ. He told them that he was not the one they were expecting. Clearly, John was content to be a voice in the wilderness, just fulfilling his purpose. He was very much at home with his purpose or calling.

When you are doing that which is not your purpose, you won’t be happy. A slice of orange may fit in a gap in a bulb of garlic. All the same, it is not garlic, and cannot be used as garlic. So also the person who finds himself, reluctantly, in a profession such as nursing or teaching or in any other place. He will only be good at messing up everything that comes his way in that profession.

_Fr. Hillary at this point tells us of his contentment as a priest when he reviews his day, at bedtime. His purpose as priest is, indeed, fulfilling._

**Prayer**: _Lord Jesus Christ, you are my source of joy. Let your joy fill my heart; the kind of joy that no one can take away; the kind of joy that no situation can take away; intense joy that makes me happy always, and bring me some day to the joys of heaven._ **Amen**.
