Theme: What makes life meaningful?

---

#### 1st Reading: Ecclesiastes, Chapter 1: 2 and Chapter 2: 21-23

The writer of this scripture cautions that all our struggles, all our anxieties and concerns are of no lasting value if we leave God out of the equation.

#### 2nd Reading: Colossians, Chapter 3:1- 5, 9 - 11

Our new life as Christians must be lived continually in the company of Christ. This way, our past behaviours will be put to death, and then we can really grow to be like Christ.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, Chapter 12: 13-21

The parable of the rich fool teaches that it is pointless to be complacent with our achievements. God should be the foundation of our well-being.
