# RETIREMENT: Part I
_by Magnus Betuur Wiedong_

_“There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens: a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot” ~ Eccl 3:1-2_

The average life expectancy in Ghana is less than 65 years (2023), and the retirement age is 60 years. The average Ghanaian will work for between 30 to 40 years in their lifetime. The question is what happens after you retire? How do you sustain your standard of living? How do you ensure you live a quality life after retirement and possibly live beyond 65 years in good health? 

In other countries, people look forward to retirement but back home people are afraid of retirement. People get apprehensive when they are approaching retirement. Why is it so? - It is because we do not plan for retirement and therefore, we see retirement as a death sentence. 
How then do you plan for retirement? 

First and foremost, you start planning for retirement the very minute you are born and you start earning some form of income (allowances and pocket monies inclusive). You start by learning about money and personal finance. You learn how to make your money work for you and not work for money till your maker calls you.

People see investing and investments as a risk and therefore would rather not invest. What they fail to realize is that not investing is even a bigger risk and the worst decision you’ll ever make in your life. Investing goes way back in time. 

In the book, ‘The richest man in Babylon’ written by George Samuel Clason, the investment principles shared are no different from what is practiced today. This is a book written in the 1920s that talks about the people of Babylon, six thousand years ago. It talks about 7 main principles or laws that govern money:

1. Start thy purse to fattening: Earn an income, save and invest (have multiple streams of income)
2. Control thy expenditures: Spend less than you earn (spend within your means)
3. Make thy gold multiply: Invest, Invest, and Invest (remember the parable of the talents?)
4. Guard thy treasures from loss: Protect your investment, don’t be greedy
5. Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment: Invest in Real Estate (landed property)
6. Insure a future income: Let your money work for you, start a side business 
7. Increase thy ability to earn: Learn in order to earn more (learn a skill, go back to school)
