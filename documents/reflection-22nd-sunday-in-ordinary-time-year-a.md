The 1st Reading and the Gospel Reading tell us about the Christian life: it isn’t all rosy. There comes a time when you have to carry your cross. The Christian life is not a promise of a soft life. It is a slippery slope. If it is God’s will that you go through a hard patch in your life, so be it. Jesus had to tell Peter to “Get behind me, Satan!” because Peter, at that moment, was being a distraction to the will of God (Mat 16: 23).

Lessons for our us:

#### Standing for God seems unrewarding, and unattractive. 

Discipleship includes suffering. In fact, your victory is tied to your cross. Jeremiah was faithful to God, and zealous for his work. Yet all he got were insults and discouragement (Jer. 20: 8-9). Just because he was working for God, difficulties followed him (Jer. 4: 1-10).

You could be asked by your detractors: “You serve God diligently, but you are still sick?” “You are still unemployed after you’ve put in so much work for your church?” With so much pressure, you begin to doubt yourself, and ask whether it is really worthwhile to carry on. Remember that Jeremiah’s woes came in torrents. He was even dumped in a pit because of false allegations about him. So, my brother, my sister, carry your cross daily.

#### Temptations to quarrel with God or to quit.

In Jeremiah 20: 7, 14-18, the prophet perceived God as a deceitful being and a bully. He even cursed the day he was born (v. 14), and had very bitter words for God. No wonder he was referred to as “The crying prophet.” We read at the end of Jeremiah Chapter 1, about the difficulties that laid ahead of his people, and the victory that awaited them at the end of the rough days. Yet this man, Jeremiah, was up in arms against God, because of the suffering he had to endure. The prophet did not, or could not quit because God’s word kept burning deep within him, however hard he tried not to speak the word (Jer. 2: 9). May this zeal for the Lord be our portion!

#### Do not lose your soul.

Don’t exchange your soul for earthly things. Don’t seek the approval of men. Even Jesus was not approved by everyone; not even in his hometown. Things may be going on well for others. They may be held in high esteem by all. You might not even be acknowledged when you are being as good as is expected of a Christian. Do you need anyone’s approval? No! Be encouraged by the words of the prophet when he declared: “But you Lord, are on my side, strong and mighty……  They will be disgraced forever. Their disgrace will never be forgotten.” (Jer. 20: 11). Let this declaration be yours as well. Place your cause, therefore, in the hands of the Lord.

**_Prayer_**

Lord Jesus Christ, as I live for you, as I carry my cross, as I do your will, whatever the distractions whatever the persecutions, I pray you, Lord, to stand beside me like a mighty warrior. Let my desire for you ever increase. Let your strength be my guide. Let your grace bring utter destruction and perpetual shame to my enemies. May standing for you increase my faith, and always, and always, and always, may I stand firm and never give up. **Amen**.
