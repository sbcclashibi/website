# Corpus Christi - Christ the King
_from Most Rev. Joseph Osei- Bonsu, Catholic Bishop of Konongo-Mampong_

**Question:** _“Some years ago, when I was young, the Eucharist was sent round in hand during Corpus Christi using the monstrance.  Why was it changed because the former looks more real than the latter, and also people get confused as to what we are portraying during Corpus Christi?”_

**Answer:**

The Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ, also known as the Feast of Corpus Christi, is held on the second Sunday after Pentecost.  It usually occurs in June. This feast, which traditionally involves a solemn procession with the eucharistic bread, developed in the 13th century. 

The theological significance of Corpus Christi lies in the fact that it celebrates God’s gift of Christ in the Spirit to the church and world as its food and drink of everlasting life. Moreover, in the celebration of this feast the church as the body of Christ experiences itself called to let the Spirit fashion it more and more into bread and drink for the world.

In many parts of Ghana, because the Feast of Corpus Christi occurs during the rainy season (June), it has been shifted to the last Sunday of Ordinary Time, usually around the end of November, when the Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Universal King, is celebrated. 

Because of the combination of these two feasts or celebrations, Christ, who is taken around in the procession in the Blessed Sacrament, is portrayed as a King, and therefore in many places the monstrance or the Blessed Sacrament is carried in a palanquin with a big umbrella over it, according Christ the same honour as one would a chief or a king in Ashanti. This is the source of the confusion!  

The idea of Christ as King seems to dominate that of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ. In those places in Ghana, where the two feasts are not joined, this kind of confusion may not arise.
