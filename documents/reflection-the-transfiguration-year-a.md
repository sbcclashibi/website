# Feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord: Year A: 6th August, 2023
_Homilist: Rev. Fr. James Gyekye Danso, Parochial Vicar, St Bakhita Catholic Church_

- _1st Reading: Daniel 7: 9-10, 13-14._
- _2nd Reading: 2 Peter 1: 16-19._
- _Gospel Reading: Matthew 17: 1b-9._

In our 1st Reading, we learn that Daniel saw a vision of the Transfiguration. The actual event is recounted in our Gospel Reading. In the 2nd Reading, Peter gives a testimony of what he and the other disciples witnessed on the mountain of the Transfiguration. 

Our reflection for the day is focused on the Gospel Reading.

**Spend quality time with the Lord**. Peter remarked that it was good that he and his colleague disciples were present on the mountain. They saw the beauty of the Transfiguration. It was “quality time” that they had with the Lord. And they were rewarded with this awesome event.

Do you stay in church throughout the Mass? Or are you eager to get out from the presence of the Lord when you should rather be savouring his presence at the Mass? Listen to this: Someone was in the habit of leaving Mass early. In fact it, leaving Mass early was like his second nature. Well, he made a complete U-turn one day when, rushing out before the end of the Mass, he was nearly knocked down by a speeding vehicle. He resolved never to “misbehave” again! 

Any lesson in this story for us? Are the two hours, or thereabouts that we spend in the presence of God too much for us? Even then, for some of us, we still manage to steal some of that time from the Lord by paying, even if briefly, some attention to our phones, or engaging in idle talk with those sitting by us.

 If we allow ourselves to be distracted by devices, absentmindedness etc, how do we expect to encounter the Lord in the Mass? Remember that Peter, James and John spent quality time with Jesus and so experienced him in the marvel of the Transfiguration. We also are positioned to have similar experiences with the Lord, and this can come true only if we spend quality time with him. The bottom line: If you have time for the Lord, he will have time for you. If you give the Lord your time, he will give you his time.

Secondly, **do not see yourself as better than, or, above others**. It was three who went with Jesus to the top of the mountain, but Peter told the Lord: “I will make you a tent….” Why didn’t he say that the three of them would make tents for the Lord, Moses and Elijah?

We are all important. Even if we have different views, let us come together to build the church. Check the “I” or the self-centeredness. Get past the “I” problem. Doing God’s work is a collective task. When we all play our roles, the joint effort will yield results that may outlive us. Working together makes all of us the one family that can make progress in building God’s church.

Third point: **Live your life; the kind of life that will take you to heaven**. Don’t live your life to please people. Peter, James and John witnessed the Transfiguration, and would defend it anywhere. So, don’t be a Christian only when you are in church. There would be nothing about the faith that you could defend. Things about God should matter to you. As a follower of Christ, your Christianity must shine through your life; in the church, the workplace or wherever you may be. Let people bear witness to your pedigree.

Fourthly, the Transfiguration of the Lord should have an impact on your life. Transfiguration means being transformed outwardly for the better. Let all know that you have encountered the Lord, like it happened to Peter, James and John. You cannot come to church with the main aim of pleasing people. There should be a transformed you when you come to church. The disciples’ perception of Jesus changed when they witnessed the Transfiguration. And so would yours.

We receive Christ every day in the Eucharist, so we must be a transformed people. The Transfiguration should have a positive impact on us. As we sing, dance praise and pray at church, let us embrace Christ who has been transfigured. Our act must include others, rather than sticking to the “I” ego.

Have a two-point conversation with yourself. It goes like this: “So, I went to Mass today. Was my mind also at Mass?

May this week be a week of transfiguration for us all.
