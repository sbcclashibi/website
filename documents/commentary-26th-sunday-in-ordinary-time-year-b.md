#### 1st Reading: Numbers, chapter 11: 25-29

The coverage area of Godâ€™s spirit is unrestricted. God can send his spirit to fill anyone he chooses, at any time he wishes, irrespective of where the person might be.

#### 2nd Reading: James, chapter 5: 1-6

St James has harsh words for the rich who exploit the poor, or anyone who indulges in social injustice, for that matter. This is a call to the faithful to rethink their social responsibilities.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark chapter 9: 38-43, 45, 47-48

Jesus encourages us to welcome anyone who shares our faith in him, or follows his example. At the same time our Lord cautions those who mislead his followers, or allow their personal weaknesses to stand in the way of their faith.
