# 23RD SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR C
Theme: Wisdom and the demands of discipleship

---

#### 1st Reading: Wisdom, Chapter 9: 13-18b

This scripture emphasises the need to pray for and to obtain wisdom from God, like the holy people of old did. God’s within us enables us to understand even the ordinary things that happen to us.

#### 2nd Reading: Philemon, verses 9-10, 12-17

Paul’s admonition to Philemon to take the runaway slave back as a brother breaks conventional wisdom. The practice of clemency, which Paul is obviously advocating, is in line with divine wisdom.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, Chapter 14: 25-33

Jesus says that those who feel called to follow Him must, like the builder of the tower and the king in the scripture, diligently weigh the options, assess their strengths and weaknesses and take a decisive step.
