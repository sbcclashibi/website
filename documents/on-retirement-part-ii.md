# Investment Options And Retirement Planning: Part II
_by Magnus Betuur Wiedong_

_We have looked at retirement in general. Let’s now look at various investment options available and retirement planning in more detail…_

### INVESTMENT OPTIONS

When it comes to investments, we have short term (maturity of less than one year), medium term (maturity between 2 to 5 years) and long term investments (maturity of more than 5 years). There is money you will need in a short period of time and there is money you may not need for a long time hence the need to put money in different investment options. 

When planning for retirement pension, you’d want to consider a long term options. Let’s look at the various investment options and then we’ll narrow down on the long term investments to help us with our retirement planning.

**Short Term**: an investment that matures in less than a year. Examples include savings accounts, fixed deposits or certificates of deposits and treasury bills (t-bills). 

There are several banks in the system and although they may not offer the best returns on savings accounts, it’s better than putting your money under your bed and sleeping on it because it loses value over time (time value of money). 

Fixed deposits usually offer higher interest rates compared to savings accounts and their rates are negotiable based on the amount of money you are investing. Their maturity periods are mostly one month, three months, six months and one year.

Treasury bills are issued by the bank of the state (e.g Bank of Ghana) to raise money for developmental projects. Treasury bills have the same maturity periods as fixed deposits and their interest rate is determined by inflation and other economic factors. 

**Medium Term**: an investment with a maturity period of 2-5 years. Mutual funds and government bonds are very good options for medium term investments.

A mutual fund is a professionally managed type of collective investment that pools money from many investors to buy stocks, bonds, short-term money market instruments, and/or other securities.

A bond is a debt investment in which an investor loans a certain amount of money, for a certain amount of time, with a certain interest rate, to the Government.

Bonds normally have maturity periods of 1 through to 5 years.

**Long Term**: these are investment options with maturity periods beyond 5 years. Good examples are stocks or shares, real estate, insurance and education.

You can buy shares in a company i.e. become a part owner of a publicly listed company and receive dividends while the value of your share appreciates (capital gain).

Real estate is the acquisition of land, landed property, buildings and housing. A friend once told me that his grandfather advised him to invest in land when he grows up because land does not rot. Real estate is a good long term investment because land is the only commodity which is no longer being manufactured or produced.

Insurance is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for payment. An insurer is a company selling the insurance; the insured, or policyholder, is the person or entity buying the insurance policy. There are a number of good insurance policies on the market. Examples include life insurance, pension and educational policies, etc.

Education is considered by some as the single most important investment one can ever make. Education is acquiring the necessary knowledge and when you invest in books, you increase your ability to earn more. Education is both formal and informal and your ability to understand the various investments options puts you in a position to make more informed decisions and choices.

To ensure your investment runs uninterrupted and to guard against unforeseen circumstances like the loss of your job, an emergency fund is highly recommended. An emergency fund is money set aside for a rainy day and it should be able to cover your expenditure for a minimum period of 6-12 months.

### RETIREMENT PLANNING

I believe we now have a good understanding of the various investment options. Let’s now look at retirement planning...

We will start by looking at SSNIT. The Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) is a statutory public trust charged under the National Pensions Acts, 2008 Act 766 with the administration of Ghana’s Basic National Social Security Scheme. The primary responsibility of the Trust is to replace part of lost income of workers due to old age, invalidity or death of a member where dependents receive a lump sum payment.

The scheme caters to both formal and informal sector employees. With the formal sector, the employer contributes a certain percentage and the employee also contributes a certain percentage of his/her salary. With the informal sector, the individual determines how much he/she wants to contribute monthly based on his/her earnings/income.  
Upon retirement, contributors receive monthly payments among other benefits. 

In a country where the housing deficit stands at 1.8 million units (2023), owning a piece of real estate will go a long way to reduce your housing/accommodation burden post retirement. There are several ways to achieve this dream. One, you can acquire a piece of land and start building during your active working years. Two, you can apply for a mortgage facility through your bank. Three, you can buy a house if you’re financially sound. However, you are blessed and in a comfortable lead if you inherited a piece of real estate.

Agribusiness, the business of agriculture is good business. It’s another area you can look at post retirement. Not only is it profitable - you’ll definitely not go hungry in your retirement. You can consider both animal and crop farming.

What happens to all the knowledge you acquired during your working life? Well, you can setup a consultancy and make some money. You can also serve on the board of companies especially startups to share your expertise and help them grow.  

Invest wisely, plan well and enjoy quality life post retirement.
