God sets certain conditions on which he would forgive our sins, and listen to our prayers. God expects us, his children to put away our innate tendency to seek revenge.

#### 2nd Reading: Romans, chapter 14: 7 - 9

The covenant between God and man is that in life and in death, we are partners with God. We need to live up to Godâ€™s expectations of us.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 18: 21 - 35

Jesus uses the parable of the unforgiving servant to teach us that there is no need to keep count of the number of times that we forgive those who offend us. Our posture must be that of unlimited forgiveness.
