# 16TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: As a shepherd tends his flock.

---

#### 1st Reading: Jeremiah, chapter 23:1-6

God warns that he will punish those shepherds, or leaders of his people, who have misled their followers. He himself will bring together and prosper his people, and will appoint for them a true shepherd, a righteous king from David’s descendants.

#### 2nd Reading: Ephesians, chapter 2:13-18

St. Paul teaches that Jews and Gentiles were brought together by Christ’s sacrifice, a sacrifice which was meant for all people. By so doing, Jesus intends that people of all nations should have a common identity, based on the universal law of love: love of God and love of neighbour.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 6: 30-34

Even though Jesus and the Apostles wanted to rest for a while, the crowd kept on coming to them. Jesus felt sad for them because “they were like sheep without a shepherd”. He assumed the role of the Good Shepherd, and began to teach them, in the same way he continues to teach us by his Word.
