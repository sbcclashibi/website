Theme: Love implies sacrifice

---

#### 1st Reading: Jeremiah, chapter 20: 7 - 9

Jeremiah nearly gives up preaching God’s word because of the humiliation and persecution that he suffered. He is however quick to backtrack because he realizes that he could no longer keep God’s word bottled up within him.

#### 2nd Reading: Romans, chapter 12: 1 - 2

St Paul explains that a life that is pleasing to God is a life that sacrifices the pleasures of the world out of love for God.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 16: 21 - 27

Jesus’ suffering and death is the result of his love for us. When we take the step to follow Christ, we are expected to reciprocate this act of sacrifice.
