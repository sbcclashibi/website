Theme: Beloved Son

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 55: 1- 11

God reaches out to us and invites us to partake in the free gifts that he showers abundantly on us. We are called to repentance, to renew our relationships with him and to reap all the benefits that his word promises.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 John chapter 5: 1-9

This scripture encourages us to express our love for God and fellow believers by obeying God's fatherly commands. We are victorious if we love Christ, who was affirmed and sent by God.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 1: 7-11

At Christâ€™s baptism, God manifested himself in the descent of the Holy Spirit, and in his own declaration. Through Christ, our baptism is an immersion in the Holy Spirit. Like Christ, we too must accept our mission obediently.
