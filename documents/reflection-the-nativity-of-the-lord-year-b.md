Today is Christmas Day. The day is themed “The Feast of Giving and Appreciation.” God gave us his greatest gift, his son, Jesus Christ. We need to appreciate this special gift.

We shall look at this homily in three parts: appreciation of the gift, the story about giving of gifts and the appreciation or otherwise, and lessons on gifts and their appreciation.

**The gift**. It is up to the receiver to accept it or not. If a gift is given and the appreciation is based on expectations, it might not really be appreciated. We can also look at the value of the gift, the value we place on the giver and the intention behind the gift. These parameters may have a bearing on how we appreciate gifts.

God gave us his only begotten son, who is God. What gift can exceed God himself, the gift who is God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God?

The value we place on the giver certainly affects our appreciation of the gift. Here, God is the giver. The amazing thing is that we cannot place a value on our infinite God. Let us look at this example: Someone made a donation in kind to the Bishop. He, in turn, gave the donor a token, a calendar. Man, was this fellow excited! He was not excited about the calendar the bishop gave him, but the fact that it came from the Bishop was enough to make him overjoyed. 

The intention of the giver often affects how we show appreciation for the gift. God gave us his son to save us from our sins. This is the more reason we should accept God’s gift of Christ to us.

Gratitude can be expressed in words, like a simple “Thank you.” It can also be expressed by being of service to the giver. Also we can learn from the giver to be generous to others.

**Kofi and his wife, Ama** were happily married. Kofi would give his wife a present every year, starting with a luxury wrist watch in the first year of their marriage, the latest iPhone the following year; expensive jewellery; and another year and the keys to a new Mercedes Benz car. These were all physical gifts. Kofi decided to give his wife a spiritual gift, so he brought home a life-size statue of the infant Jesus. Because of her high expectations this time round, Ama, his wife rejected the gift, fuming as to whether she was married to him, Kofi, or to Jesus. That was the beginning of their problems as husband and wife.

Do not be like Ama. Do not base your appreciation of a gift on your expectations. The gift was Jesus. The giver was her husband. Jesus was the intention behind the gift. She missed out, sadly. Be like Kofi who appreciated what God has given us.

**Lessons:** We should express our appreciation to God by thanking him. That is why we are here today.  Show appreciation to God by serving him; in church and outside of the church. Find ways to serve your God. The avenues are countless.

God has been generous to us. We learn from him to be generous to others. As you receive, so do you give, else you become like stagnant water which, eventually, begins to stink. Be a channel of God’s grace to others.

So, my brother, my sister, accept God’s gift to us. Christ is a gift from God Almighty on whom we cannot or dare not place a value. May his blessings abound in our lives in multiples of thousands and millions.
