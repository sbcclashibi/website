Form the second stanza of the song titled “I have decided to follow Jesus,” we sing: “The cross before me, the world behind me...”

This fits in well with our Readings today. The Gospel Reading can be summarized by the phrase let your Yes” be yes, and your “No,” be no. It is “Yes!” to the Lord. Yes; to work in the vineyard of the Lord.

The vineyard of the Lord is the world we live in; how we relate to our fellow beings, be it family, workmates etc. It is Yes to the Lord, to do that which is pleasing to him, that is, to serve the Lord and our neighbour, to love as God expects us to love, and to stay in the joy of the Lord.

The first son said “No,” but changed his mind and went to work in the vineyard. He did the right thing, right? Certainly.

It is not wise to say yes in order to be a people pleaser, and not do what you are expected to do. How do you take it when someone says he would do something, and fails to do that which he had promised? This is pure deception. It is disappointing, painful, and indeed, sad.

When it comes to our spiritual lives, we must aim at pleasing God, and not others. We should not set as our objective, to prove ourselves (in the eyes of mortals) but to improve ourselves only to God. God knows us through and through. He knows the efforts we make everyday to improve ourselves so we can sit right with him. Don’t prove yourself, but improve yourself. Your Yes should be improving yourself as far as your relationship with God is concerned.

St. Bakhita (The Fortunate One), the Patron Saint of our church, provides us with a vivid example of what is expected of us when we say Yes to God. She had been sold into slavery five times, until the Lord created the circumstances that finally saw her enter a convent to become a Religious. She said Yes to God, and so served the Lord effectively, joyfully and lovingly. It is the same characteristics of serving God effectively, joyfully and lovingly that we need when serving in the Lord’s vineyard.

St Bakhita is remembered for her kindness, love and the effectiveness with which she served, and that played a big role in drawing people to the Lord. This should be an encouragement for those of us who seek her intercession.
