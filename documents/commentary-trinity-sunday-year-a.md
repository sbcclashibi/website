# TRINITY SUNDAY
Theme: The ineffable mystery of God

#### 1st Reading: Exodus, chapter 34: 4b – 6, 8 – 9

God reveals his nature by declaring that he is full of compassion, extremely kind and always close to us. Our response to such show of love and faithfulness is to bow in deep reverence, like Moses did.

#### 2nd Reading: 2 Corinthians, chapter 13: 11 – 13

Parts of the scripture we are about to hear are constantly on the lips of the faithful. Anytime we share the Grace, let us remember that we are invoking the Holy Spirit to come down and remain upon us.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 3: 16 – 18

God loves us so much so that out of his own free-will, he gave us Jesus Christ, his son, to save us. The only condition we have to fulfill is to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.
