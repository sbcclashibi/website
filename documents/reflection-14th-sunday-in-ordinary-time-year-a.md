The First Reading is a message of hope. The Israelites were under oppression, by one powerful kingdom or the other. Their troubles seemed endless, all because of their geographical location which was a priced trade route. Empires therefore fought to control the land of the Israelites.

The prophet Zechariah tells them: "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of
Jerusalem!...Your king comes as a victor (Zech 9: 9).

For all who are suffering, say "Rejoice!" because Jesus is coming to you. This king is already victorious; he is coming on a donkey, to command peace to the world. He is coming on his own terms (Zech. 9: 10). He is coming for your heart!

The king who comes is a humble king, banishing the instruments of violence; no chariots, no spears, no arms. He is already victorious, so he does not need to come preparing for war. Let us also deal with the instruments of violence in our lives; the anger, the hatred, the unforgiveness etc. Let go of them, so you can savour the peace that Jesus brings.

In the Second Reading, St Paul tells us about two ways of life: life in the Spirit and life in the flesh. Your life in the Spirit must be prompted by the Holy Spirit.

We are admonished to open our hearts to the Holy Spirit to transform us into the likeness of Christ. If you live in the Spirit, you won't be preparing for battle. Many of us find it difficult to live a life in the Spirit because of various distractions, and are, therefore, perpetually in battle mode, to the detriment of our lives.

The Christian and the Church have been persecuted throughout the ages because their life is against what the world delights in. Some forms of entertainment, for example, and some stand points we firmly hold unto, as well as some utterances we make do not promote life in the Spirit.

For instance, a Christian who talks down the value of marriage is not a Christian. These days, we are exposed to what would rather damage us, so we live on our own terms instead of giving our lives to Christ. We must know that the resurrection of Christ is evidence that the same Spirit, the same power that raised our Lord from the dead can transform us.

The burdens of life, and the choices we make can also make us suffer. The life of a Christian is one that is animated by the Holy Spirit. It is not a life that js couched by yourself. You have to believe what Christians believe. We can only fall in line by being submissive to the Lord, as Christ tells us in the Gospel Reading.

God, who is sufficient in all goodness, will provide our needs. For us whose choices have burdened us and so we find ourselves in uncomfortable places, Jesus invites us to come to him. His yoke is comfortable. His burden is love, something that we can easily bear. This yoke will fit us comfortably.

The yoke of Jesus is an obligation. We are obliged to give him our lives, so we can move in the same direction as the Lord. He shares power with us, and he will give us rest.

In the rest of Jesus, we have joy, we have victory, we have peace, and we have hope.
