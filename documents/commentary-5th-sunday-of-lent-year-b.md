# 5TH SUNDAY OF LENT YEAR B
Theme: Death as a Metamorphosis into a Better Life

---

#### 1st Reading: Jeremiah, chapter 31: 31-34

God says that he will make a new covenant with us; a covenant that will be written in our hearts, so that by instinct, we will know Him.

#### 2nd Reading: Hebrews, chapter 5: 7-9

God heard the prayers of Christ, because he humbled himself, and was totally obedient to him. Because of this act, we who obey Christ will gain eternal salvation.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 12: 20-33

Jesus speaks about his death. By referring to the mystery of the grain of wheat, which dies in order to produce new life, Christ is preparing our minds to the fact that his passion will draw all of us to himself.
