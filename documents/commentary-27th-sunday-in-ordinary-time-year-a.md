Theme: Appreciation

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 5: 1 - 7

God takes special care for us, his vineyard, but is disappointed by our inability to live up to what he expects us to be. Indeed, he is justified to punish those who do not appreciate his love and care.

#### 2nd Reading: Philippians, chapter 4: 6 - 9

St Paul exhorts us that if we want to enjoy the peace that comes from the Lord, we must not only replace our worries with prayers, but also fill our minds with thoughts that are wholesome in the eyes of the Lord.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 21: 33 - 43

The parable of the Lord’s vineyard teaches that if we do not appreciate God’s favour and give him his due, then he would look elsewhere for those who would return his love.
