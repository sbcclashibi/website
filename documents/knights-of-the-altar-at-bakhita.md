# The Knights and Ladies of the Altar

The Knights and Ladies of the Altar (KNOLTA) is a parish-based liturgical ministry composed of individuals - especially the youth - who assist the priest during mass and contribute to the orderly and reverent celebration of the liturgy. The ministry is dedicated to nurturing both the spiritual development and spirit of service of its members, forming altar servers who serve with devotion, discipline and respect for the sacred.

Members of KNOLTA are entrusted with preparing the sanctuary before mass, arranging sacred vessels and liturgical items and providing essential support throughout the liturgy. To strengthen their skills and deepen their understanding of service, the ministry meets every Saturday at 4:00 pm for training, planning and spiritual instruction.

Before becoming full members, individuals undergo adequate training, after which an initiation ceremony is held once or twice a year to formally welcome and induct them into the ministry. This process ensures that every altar server understands their role, responsibilities and the reverence required in serving at the altar.

KNOLTA emphasizes important values such as discipline, punctuality, teamwork and responsibility, shaping members into committed altar servers and well-rounded individuals. The ministry is inspired by its patron, Saint John Berchmans, the patron saint of altar servers, whose humility and devotion guides all members in their conduct.

A major highlight of the ministry’s year is the Feast Day Celebration on the 26th of November, observed at either the archdiocesan or deanery level. This event brings together KNOLTA members from various parishes for a time of fellowship, social interaction and shared learning. Through educational sessions, bonding activities and communal celebrations, members strengthen their unity and deepen their commitment to their calling.
