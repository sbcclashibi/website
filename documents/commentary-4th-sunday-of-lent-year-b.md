# 4TH SUNDAY OF LENT YEAR B
Theme: The Son of Man Lifted Up, That All May Have Eternal Life In Him

---

#### 1st Reading: 2 Chronicles, chapter 36: 14-16, 19-23

The Jews were exiled in Babylon because of their sins and their refusal to repent. Sin separates us from God, but the promise of salvation and eternal happiness belongs to those who are willing to return to God.

#### 2nd Reading: Ephesians, chapter 2: 4-10

Because of God’s love and care for us, he gave us the gift of salvation through Christ. God did this out of his own freewill, not as a reward for anything we may have done.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 3: 14-21

This scripture contains the well-known bible verse: “For God so loved the world…” We must see this quotation in the context of God’s overall plan for us, which enjoins us to look to Christ, with faith and penance.
