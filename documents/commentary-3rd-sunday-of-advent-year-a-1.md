# 3RD SUNDAY OF ADVENT YEAR A
Theme: Joyful in hope

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 35: 1 – 6a, 10

The prophet Isaiah paints a picture of hope for a people who are in exile, and for many of us who are about to give up because of hardships and uncertainties. Our suffering, he says, shall soon be a thing of the past, because our God is here!

#### 2nd Reading: The letter of James, chapter 5: 7 – 10

As the farmer waits patiently between planting and harvesting, or as the prophets of old kept their faith and hope alive, so must believers wait for the return of the Lord.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 11: 2 –11

We sometimes wonder, as John the Baptist did, whether Jesus is the Messiah. The Lord invites all of us to see the miracles that are occurring before our own eyes!
