*To: Priests, Religious and Lay Faithful of the Archdiocese*

Dearly Beloved,

#### DIRECTIVES FOR THE CELEBRATION OF HOLY WEEK IN 2023

**Preamble**

The peace of the Lord be with you!

We thank God that the COVID-19 pandemic has largely phased out. However, there is an outbreak of Lassa Fever in our country. So, generally, while the COVID-19 protocols have been relaxed, let us observe the good hygiene practices acquired during the height of the pandemic.

Therefore, priests should ensure that the necessary precautions are taken as they implement the following directives for the 2023 Holy Week and Easter Monday:

1. **Palm Sunday.** In the churches of the Archdiocese, the Commemoration of the Lord's Entrance into Jerusalem is to be celebrated using **any** of the **three forms** indicated in the Roman Missal.

2. **The Chrism Mass.** The Chrism Mass will be celebrated on Wednesday, 5th April 2023 at 10am at the Holy Spirit Cathedral, Adabraka. Participation is open to all Priests, Religious and lay faithful.

3. **Holy Thursday.** The washing of feet is optional. The faithful are to receive the Holy Eucharist under only the specie of bread. There should be the transfer of the Eucharist and adoration at the end of the Lord's Supper.

4. **Good Friday.** The veneration of the Cross by kissing shall be limited solely to the (main) celebrant; concelebrants and all the faithful may either touch the Cross with **sanitized** hands or simply bow before it. Where the Stations of Cross is to be conducted (earlier in the day), it may take place on the church's compound or inside the church.

5. **The Easter Vigil.** The Liturgy of Light may begin with the faithful on the church's compound. For the "Baptismal Liturgy" all the required norms are to be observed.

6. **Easter Sunday.** Where some receive their First Holy Communion, it should be done under only the specie of bread.

7. **Easter Monday.** The picnic may be held.

Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to wish you all a fruitful celebration of the Lord's passion and resurrection.

Yours in the crucified and risen Christ, <br>
+John B. Kwofie <br>
