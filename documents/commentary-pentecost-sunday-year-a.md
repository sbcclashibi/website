# PENTECOST SUNDAY
Theme: The Spirit at work

---

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles, chapter 2: 1-11

The Holy Spirit descended on the disciples, and they spoke in various tongues. The Pentecost event shows that the Christian message is meant for all people.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, chapter 12: 3b - 7, 12 - 13.

St Paul explains to the congregation at Corinth, and to all of us, that the Holy Spirit manifests itself in several ways, and that through the same Holy Spirit, we all are members in the one Body of Christ.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 20: 19 - 23.

John’s account of the Pentecost is based on Jesus’ appearance in the midst of his disciples, soon after the resurrection. He breathed the Holy Spirit into them, and empowered them to continue his work. Christ invites us this day, to receive his life-transforming Holy Spirit.
