loving God has laid out for them.

#### 2nd Reading: 2 Corinthians Ch. 5: 20-ch. 6: 2.

St. Paul emphasizes that the sinless Christ died for our sins. The best time for us to embrace God’s amnesty that is offered by Christ’s death is now!

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew Ch. 6: 1-6, 16-18.

penance. It is only God, the Father, who knows the depth of our
repentance, and it is he who will reward us appropriately.
