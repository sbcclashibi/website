Lessons from the 1st Reading and the Gospel Reading:

#### 1. God is the source of all authority and power.
 In the 1st Reading, we read that God was angry with Shebna because he refused to play his leadership role as was required of him (Is. 22: 19).

Shebna is not alone in this “quagmire.” Don’t we know of bible-quoting politicians who turn their backs on the people after gaining power? Or the bible-wielding men of God who don’t live up to expectation? Even among the lay faithful; you haven’t met those who crave for leadership positions in societies, but end up not contributing to the buoyancy of the society?

The one who gave you the power is the same person who can direct you as to how to use it. Power corrupts, we are told; and we know. But this should not be said about a Christian who is a leader. The same applies to you as a boss in an organization. 

#### 2. Be a reliable, dependable and trustworthy person. 
This comes out clearly both in the 1st Reading and the Gospel Reading. Eliakim was trustworthy (Is. 22: 20), and so was chosen to replace Shebna. In the Gospel Reading, the Lord told Peter that he was “the rock on which I will build my church” (Matthew 16: 18). Peter was indeed reliably, so Jesus could entrust the keys of the kingdom to him!

It is difficult, in this age, to get people who are reliable, dependable and trustworthy. There are several real life stories which lend credence to this statement. Strive not to be counted among the unreliable persons.

#### 3. It is good to know what others think about you.
Feedback is a powerful way to know how others see you. Feedback will let you know how to walk properly. It’s up to all of us, parents, bosses etc. to embrace feedback.

Jesus asked: “Who do people say the Son of Man is? And also “What about you; who do you say I am?” (See Matt 16: 13b-15b). He got consolation from Peter’s response: “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God” (Matt 16: 16).

Even Jesus saw the need for feedback. How much more we, mere mortals? Allow people to assess you. Your performance will change for the better.

#### 4. Keep that which is a secret, a secret. 
The last sentence in today’s Gospel Reading says that Jesus asked his disciples to tell no one about who he was. You may catch a friend red-handed doing something rather bad; even disgraceful. Are you the one to spread the news about his misdeed? No! Caution him, and emphatically warn him about the publicity he would attract should you catch him indulging in the malfeasance one more. This does not mean you are condoning bad deeds; you are saving the person from committing, who knows, a far greater and/or worse offence.

May the Lord guide us and journey with us this week.
