Homilist: Rev. Fr. James Gyekye Danso, Parochial Vicar, St Bakhita Catholic Church. 

_1st Reading: Isaiah 45: 4-6._
_2nd Reading: 1 Thessalonians 1: 1-5b._
_Gospel Reading: Matthew 22: 15-21._

---

We learn from the 1st Reading that God chose Cyrus, a pagan king, to save his people, Israel. God can choose anyone to fulfil his promise. In the 2nd Reading, Paul thanks the Thessalonians for accepting and living out the faith. This is a challenge for us to do likewise.

The Gospel Reading is the focus of our reflection.

**1. We need to give to Caesar what is Caésar’s.** In the same vein, we need to give to our nation what it is due.

Some people, i.e. individuals and corporate bodies are unwilling to pay taxes, with several excuses, including the excuse that they are Christians. As Christians, it is our duty to not only pay, but to also actively encourage everyone to do likewise. The question we don’t often ask is: If you don’t pay your taxes, which is a civic duty, how do you expect the country to run? Is it right, therefore, to expect the government to provide amenities to the citizenry if you don’t pay your taxes? Think about it.

It is also our civic responsibility to speak out when things are not going well in the society. Our voices will ensure peace. A peaceful atmosphere will bring about the tranquil environment that we require to live our lives, and, indeed, gather for worship. 

Make it your civic and Christian duty to criticize the wrong, because failure to do so will adversely affect us all. We are Christians. Yes! We are citizens. Yes. Let us carry out our civic responsibilities by giving to Caesar what belongs to him.

**2. We need to give to God what is God’s.**

Well, an old man was admitted to the hospital, where he was put on oxygen. His bill, for the 24 hours that he breathed the oxygen was Five Thousand Ghana Cedis. That got him weeping.; not because he couldn’t pay, but because, as he said, he has had free air (oxygen) for ninety years. He wept because he believed he owed God so much. The doctor couldn’t help but join in the weeping.

The doctor realized that he also owed the Lord. What about you? What about me? We owe God; don’t we?

We have to give to support God’s work. We have to support the church. Today, we are alive. Even if we are sick or unwell, we have free air to breathe. 

It is our Christian duty to provide for God. We provide for God by giving our entire lives to him, by doing things his way; not our way. The laws of God must be part of us. That is why the commandments are there to guide us. It is indefensible to live your live anyhow, and appear in church to “partake in worship,” and think you are a Christian. Complete surrender to God’s way is the way to give to God.

**3. Seek further clarification and understanding before you make a decision.**

When the Pharisees and the Herodians approached Jesus for his views on the payment of taxes, he asked them to bring a coin. The coin had the image of Caesar. So, “Render therefore the things that are Caesar’s, and to God, the things that are God’s.” (Matthew 22: 21).

End of story. Beautifully delivered. Jesus patiently composed his response to the enquirers. What this teaches us is that we should not be quick to offer answers or opinions on issues. You may not know when your response to a statement or another person’s remarks will be used against you.

It might be a comment about your boss by a co-worker, or a rumor about your spouse, or a rumor about your friend. You may commit yourself if you do not take your time to ponder over the issue before opening your mouth. Learn from Jesus.

**4. Not all praise is genuine.**

The Pharisees and their conspirators-in-arms, the Herodians, “went and took counsel how to entangle Jesus…” “Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God truthfully….” (Matthew 22: 15-18). They were praising Jesus, with flattery; praising him left and right. But behind the praises was a different agenda; to trap Jesus.

People will sing your praises. Be careful. The young lady would suddenly find a voice for sweet words for the young man she had continuously spurned, because she has heard about some goodies he has. Be careful. The young man may come singing the praises of the young woman, promising her the moon. Be careful. Your co-worker may bring up a conversation about your boss. Your response will get to the ear of your boss. Be careful.

And you, the boss, will hear your workers singing your praises because of what you have been doing for them. Just delay their salary for a week! You will see their true colours. So, be careful. 

For Jesus, his detractors meant to trap him. For you, they may aim at bringing you down. So, be careful.

We pray that God will use us as he used King Cyrus, to bring changes in the lives of others as well as the church. May we, like the people of Thessalonica, accept the word of God, to be doers of the word, and not mere hearers.
