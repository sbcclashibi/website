# 21ST SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR A
Theme: Support your Bishop

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 22: 19 - 23

The Lord brings down an unfaithful servant, and installs a more credible one in his place. The worthy servant shall exercise God’s authority over his people.

#### 2nd Reading: Romans, chapter 11: 33 - 36

No one has ever understood God’s mind, nor can anyone reason by his standards. Again, God does not owe us anything! Our duty is to acknowledge his eternal glory.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 16: 13 - 20

The Church today exercises the authority conferred on Peter by Jesus Christ, through the Apostolic succession. When we support our Bishops, we are, in fact throwing our weight behind Jesus, our Lord!
