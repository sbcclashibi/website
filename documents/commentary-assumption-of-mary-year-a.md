Theme: Mary is taken up to Heaven.

#### 1st Reading: Revelation, chapter 11: 19a and chapter 12: 1-6a, 10b

This scripture provides an insight into the battle between a queenly but vulnerable woman, the embodiment of Mother Mary, and the evil one. In the end, we see the protection God provides his own, so we escape the traps of the evil one.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, chapter 15: 20-27

St Paul explains that for now Jesus, the resurrected Christ reigns as king, until all evil is defeated. At the end of time he will hand over his kingdom to God the father so that the redeemed can relate to God directly.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 1: 39-56

Mary’s focus and commitment to the goal of bearing the Messiah earned her the title “Blessed”. If we also trust that the Lord’s words to us, especially about the coming of the Saviour would be fulfilled, then we too shall be blessed.
