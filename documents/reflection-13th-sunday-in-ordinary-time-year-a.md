In Jewish culture, when you receive a messenger “nicely,” you are, by extension receiving he who sent the messenger nicely. Similar courtesies are extended to the exchange of ambassadors (in the field of diplomacy).

This fact can be applied to what Jesus says about doing good to neighbour: “Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto **_me_** (Matt. 25: 40).

Saul, later, Paul, persecuted the followers of Christ; or so he thought. The Lord asked him: Saul, Saul, why do you persecute **_me_**? (Acts 9: 4).

These examples set the stage for our 1st Reading, and the lessons inherent in that scripture.

**Truly generous people never tire of doing good.** The woman at Shunem saw beyond a man passing, every now and then, to a man of God. She discerned him to be a man of God! She told her husband about her intention to make provision for this gentleman, Elisha, and her husband lent his full support. They went the extra mile to provide lodgings for the man of God, Elisha. Her reward was a child, a son.

We all have “brothers” who are hungry, or in need of one thing or the other. May God give us the perception to see these needy persons so we can extend a helping hand to them.

**Grateful men must derive grateful plans.** We must think of what to do in return for a good deed. You can pray for your benefactor. The prophet began to think of what to do in return for the hospitality shown by the woman and her husband. He used his heavenly influence to intercede for the woman. If you cannot return a favour with things physical, you can count on the court of heaven to hear your intercessory prayers for them.

**Kindness to the prophet provoked a blessing from the God of the prophet.** The woman built a room for the prophet Elisha, furnished with a bed, a table, and a bedside lamp, among other items. God built a generation for her. She had been childless, but the prophet prayed for her to have a son. You cannot outdo God in in generosity. This is a fact. The little you do will be rewarded abundantly. You support a prophet and a prophet’s reward you will receive.

There’s the story of a young man who yearned to be a priest, but could not become one. He pursued something else, becoming a shoemaker, and made shoes for a seminarian; not once, not twice. It even continued after his ordination. When asked why he constantly supplied the priest with shoes, he told his story, and concluded by stating that when the priest wore his shoes, he was literally standing in his shoes. Simple. Through his generosity, he was participating in the ministry of the priest.

Any act of kindness you do will be extensively multiplied by God. In fact, your blessings are in what you do (Heb. 13: 2).

And don’t forget Abraham’s generosity as recounted in Genesis chapter 18. When you want to do good to people, don’t delay.

May God give us the perception to see the prophets of God, the messenger of God and our needy neighbours, and move to action.
