# 5TH SUNDAY OF EASTER, YEAR B
Theme: Our union with the Lord in the community of the Church.

---

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles, chapter 9: 26-31. 

The congregation at Jerusalem refused to accept the newly-converted Paul as one of them, because they did not trust him. The message in this scripture is that a professed good relationship with God and Jesus alone is insufficient: we need the support of our fellow believers if we are to participate fully in the Christian life. 

#### 2nd Reading: 1st letter of John, chapter 3: 18-24.

This scripture teaches that we should not just talk about our love for our neighbour, but that we should translate that love into action. The reading also reminds us of our saviour’s commandment that we should love one another, so that we can be in Christ, and he in us.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 15: 1-8 

Jesus is the true vine on which all the faithful grow, as branches. God is the vine-grower, who makes sure that we are producing good fruits. We can only grow on Jesus, the vine, and so we must develop and maintain a living relationship with him.
