Theme: The Good Shepherd

--- 

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles, chapter 2: 14a, 36 - 41

Peter’s declaration and explanation of the Lordship and divinity of the crucified but resurrected Christ so moved his listeners that about three thousand of them received the Lord in that single day.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Peter, chapter 2: 20b – 25

Following Jesus, the Good Shepherd, means sharing in his trials, his joys and ultimately experiencing his loving and tender care.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 10: 1 – 10

In this scripture, we see the Lord’s twin role of gate and sheep-fold, as indicative of the total security Jesus provides for the people that he pastures.
