Let us reflect on the following points:

#### 1. Be a moral watchman or watchwoman.

God told the prophet Ezekiel that had made him a watchman for the house of Israel (Eze. 33: 7). This is a command that he, the prophet was the moral watchman over Israel. A moral watchman is one who goes out of his way to point out the wrongs in society in order to elicit a change in behaviours and attitudes. 

Take a listen to the story about the sister whose persistent comments about the two young men and their preoccupation; persistent rebuke and insinuations that goaded the two young men to ditch certain mindsets, which could have landed them in some sorts of sins, and eventually became ordained priests. 

It is not easy to tell people the truth about themselves; but that is what God wants us to do. God is telling us to be moral watchmen. Unacceptable things that are happening in our society today because we Christians and others who can assume the role of moral watchmen are quiet.

If you tell a brother to mend his ways and he does, fine. You have done your duty. But if he does not, you will not share in his punishment (Eze.33: 8-9).

It is not only the church that is expected to be a moral watchman. Parents, teachers, bosses at the workplace etc. are expected to speak out when morals are being relegated to something that would be detrimental to the common good.

Like the watchman in the generally acceptable parlance, a moral watchman is required to be on duty 24/7. If you do not correct someone, who knows: that person’s children might pick up those traits, grow with them and populate society with their unacceptable ways of life.  Society would suffer. And you would have done the nation a disservice.

#### 2. Correct a brother or a sister fraternally.

Jesus said: “If your brother sins against you, …” (Matt. 18: 15-17). In this scripture passage, Jesus outlines how we are to resolve disputes.

First, go as an individual to talk matters over with the offender. Secondly, go with others, who would serve as witnesses to your effort at reconciliation. Thirdly, bring the case before the church if the first two steps fail.

Nowadays, we do the exact opposite. We first broadcast our grievance to a wide audience, who invariably share the “news” with all manner of twists, before the offender gets to know that he is an offender. Just imagine!

Remember the story of the elderly woman who talked a young lady out of wearing what was considered indecent dressing? That is the way a moral watchwoman succeeded in putting the young lady right. Nobody was bold enough to do it, but she did, “coolly,’ as we would say in this part of the world.

In fact this is the point St. Paul is making in the 2nd Reading; fraternal correction of an erring brother (Rom. 13:8a, 10). Always, seek to correct in love.

#### 3. Learn to forgive.

Forgiveness is very difficult, especially after a betrayal, or, after a show of gratitude which is not appreciated or reciprocated. But this is what Christ is asking us to do. We must find a place in our hearts to forgive.

We know the saying: “To err is human; to forgive, divine.” It is only human beings who err. It is obvious, therefore, that it is only human beings who must forgive.

Remember the part of The Lord’s prayer where we rattle: “...and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.” Praying these words without living them is a huge joke.

Sometimes, the spirit of unforgiveness can grow into a generational hatred, passing on to children and grandchildren. Let us be on our guard. Let go. Allow God to take over. Allow time to heal. If you, the offended, have to make the first move towards forgiveness and reconciliation, go ahead and do so.

Forgiveness is hard, but attainable. Your brother may not know that he has offended you, but you, the moral watchman or woman, have a duty to set things right fraternally.
