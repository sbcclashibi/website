# 2ND SUNDAY OF EASTER (DIVINE MERCY SUNDAY) YEAR A
Theme: Faith and fellowship

---

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles chapter 2: 42 – 47

The early church in Jerusalem grew rapidly because of the common identity of faith and fellowship among the congregation. The church today can benefit immensely from the examples of our ancestors in the faith.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Peter, chapter 1: 3 – 9

Peter compares our rebirth through baptism, to the resurrection of Jesus. This regeneration positions us to access what Peter describes as our imperishable inheritance.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 20: 19 - 31

Jesus greets his disciples with the peace offering, and breathed the Holy Spirit on them, to empower them. Christ’s statement: “Blessed are they who have not seen and have believed,” underscores the importance of faith in the life of the Christian.
