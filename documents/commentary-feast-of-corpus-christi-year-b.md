# SOLEMNITY OF THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST (CORPUS CHRISTI) YEAR B
Theme: Sharing life with Christ.

---

#### 1st Reading: Exodus, chapter 24: 3-8

God ratifies the blood covenant with the nation, Israel. The object of the sacrifice was an animal, whose blood was proof that one life had been exchanged for another. Some of the blood was sprinkled on the altar, the symbol of God, and the rest on the people to show that they could now be re-united to God.

#### 2nd Reading: Hebrews, chapter 9: 11-15

Jesus Christ is the High Priest, who shed his own blood as atonement for our sins. Our saviourâ€™s blood is the perfect sacrifice. It is superior to the blood of animals, and that is why the new covenant, signified by the blood of Jesus, is greater than any other sacrifice.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 14: 12-16, 22-26

Jesus chose the Feast of Passover to institute the Holy Eucharist, as we know it today. By commanding us to celebrate the Holy Eucharist in his memory, Jesus is reminding us of the price he paid for our salvation.
