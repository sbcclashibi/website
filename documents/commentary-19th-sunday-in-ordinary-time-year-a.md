#### 1st Reading: 1 Kings, chapter 19: 9a, 11 – 13a

While escaping the wrath of Queen Jezebel, the prophet Elijah encountered the Lord, not in the dramatic way he had expected, but in a “tiny whispering sound”. The message for us is that God comes to us in ways we least expect.

#### 2nd Reading: Romans, chapter 9: 1 - 5

Paul expresses the depth of his love for his fellow Jews, by daring to be separated from Jesus, for their sake, if it came to that.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 14: 22 - 33

Jesus suddenly appears in the midst of a storm, and not only calms the storm, but also saves Peter from drowning. The Lord is ever ready to come to our aid in marvelous ways.
