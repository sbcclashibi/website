God called Elijah to go to the mountain to experience him. A great and strong wind came, followed by an earthquake, and fire, in that order. God was not in any of these terrifying elements. Then came “a still small voice.” The Lord was in that small and undramatic voice.

**Recognize the little voices around you**. In looking for solutions to resolve challenges, we may hear several opinions from experts of various shades and character. Remember that there is always a small voice around you, patiently waiting for you to lend it your listening ear. It may come from your subordinate, your child or even your student, i.e., from sources which you are likely to ignore or avoid under normal circumstances. That voice is the voice of God.

**Have full knowledge about the people around you**. The disciples had been walking with Jesus all this while. But….. He walked on water, and they thought he was a ghost!?!? Yet, it happened to the disciples. It can happen to you, too!

Ask yourself a few questions: Do you know your spouse to the extent that you can accurately predict his/her next move? Do you know the kind of work s/he does? Do you know your children, to the extent that you can vouch for them when you hear adverse reports about their behaviour from other sources, such as his or her teachers? How well do you know your friends, your neighbours etc.? it is amazing how shallow our knowledge of those closet to us is.

Be conscious about the people around you. Your environment must be of prime interest to you. Your child, for example, may be battling certain issues that your lame eyes may be unable to see. Know your child. A similar admonition goes to children as well: know your parents.

**Deal with your own wind**. Peter saw a ghost. Due to fear and anxiety, a small wind nearly “floored” him, until he called on the Lord to save him. 

What wind is blowing you away from Christ? Is it the wind of gossip? Or petty thievery? Or bribe taking? Or lust? Or one of several vices? Or what? Are you programmed to abhor suggestions and advice from others? 

These winds prevent you from focusing on your goal, like it happened to Peter. He lost his focus, and began to sink. And so would you sink in your mess if you don’t take action.

Check your wind. 

**Peter, realizing he was sinking, invited Christ to save him**. The same saving grace is within your reach if you invite Christ to clear up the mess, or the wind in which you find yourself. Let us be like Peter, who uttered those powerful words. “Save me!” should be our prayer.

Sometimes, you pray, but you don’t want to stop the bad things you are doing. It is like you don’t want to let go. Ask, like Peter did, for the Lord’s assistance. The wind you are battling will cease.
