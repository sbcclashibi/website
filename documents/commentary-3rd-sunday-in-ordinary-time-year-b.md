# 3RD SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: Call, reluctance and repentance

---

#### 1st Reading: Jonah, chapter 3: 1-5, 10

God calls the city of Nineveh to repentance. We see how our caring father does not hesitate to show mercy when we show remorse for our sins and return to him.

##### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, chapter 7: 29-31

All human values of the present age would be of no use in the world to come. The message to the faithful is that we should remain guided by our commitment to be followers of Christ.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 1: 14-20

Jesus calls us to repent and to embrace the Good News. He calls us, as he did his disciples, to leave everything and follow him.
