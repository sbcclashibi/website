# 24th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME: YEAR B
Theme: Taking up our cross.

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah chapter 50: 5-9a

This scripture is, in fact, a song that extols the virtues of carrying your own cross, and following the Messiah. It is also a call to the faithful to adopt a new attitude towards their Christian way of life, and, by so doing, walk in the presence of the Lord.

#### 2nd Reading: James, chapter 2: 14-18

St James teaches that faith, without good deeds, is useless. True Christian charity may be difficult, but it is the kind of sacrifice that makes our faith real and acceptable in the sight of the Lord.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark chapter 8: 27-35

St Peter declares that Jesus is the Messiah. Jesus, as it were, nods in agreement, and begins to teach his disciples about his death and resurrection, as well as the need for all who want to follow him to deny their very selves, and take up their crosses
