# 7TH SUNDAY OF EASTER YEAR C
Theme: The image of Jesus Christ keeps us together

---

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles, Chapter 7: 55-60

The martyrdom of St Stephen should convince us that it is more than worthy to stand up for Jesus in the face of all opposition, even at the peril of our lives.

#### 2nd Reading: Revelation, Chapter 22: 12-14, 16-17, 20

Jesus is the beginning and the end. In fact, he is the all-in-all for those who strive to remain faithful to him. Christ invites everyone to accept all that he stands for.

#### Gospel Reading: John, Chapter 17:20-26

Jesus prays for his disciples, and all of us who follow him, for unity, God’s protection and sanctity. It is our Lord’s desire that we remain united with him in the same way as he is united with God, our Creator.
