The Gospel Reading tells us that the man who found the treasure in the field, and the merchant who found the pearl “of great value” sold all that they had in order to purchase the field, and the pearl respectively. Both were able to exchange what they had for what they yearned for. We must be ready to give up everything for God’s kingdom.

Our reflection is based largely on our First reading.

- Solomon encountered God at Gibeon. We are told that his request pleased God. 

- It is important to note that the nearer we come to God, the more probable it is that he will gift us a divine manifestation. (See also 1 Chronicles 1: 3 ff).

- To Solomon, wisdom was a means to an end; the end being to lead God’s people. Solomon frequented the tabernacle; so should we. We read in 1 Samuel 3: 1ff, that Eli was lying “at his place,” while Samuel was sleeping in the temple of the Lord. This was at a time when “there was no manifestation of vision.” In other words, prophecy was scares. Any wonder that the Lord chose to speak to the one who constantly made the temple his “base?” That “base” was the tabernacle, where Samuel frequented, and subsequently, encountered God. 

- Secondly, Solomon offered a sacrifice that befitted his status as king. And that is the kind of sacrifice we have to offer. We need to ask ourselves this question: “What return shall I give to God? Is what I offer befitting of God? Does it reflect what God has done for me?” This brings to mind the lesson we learn from the widow who offered all she had, and was therefore commended by Jesus Christ (Mark 12: 42).

- Well, God told Solomon to ask whatever he wanted, and that he would give it to him. His generous sacrifice was rewarded with a blank cheque. Our prayer requests, like Solomon’s, must display our utmost desires.

- Solomon preceded his prayer request with thanksgiving, and asked, in humility, for wisdom (ie an understanding heart, a listening heart and a hearing heart), so that at all times, he would please God (See also James 1: 5). There are lessons for us in this scripture, too.  

- When your request pleases God, his response will overwhelm you. God gave Solomon much, much more than he had asked for. Read over 1 Kings 3: 12-14 a couple of times, to appreciate what awaits you. Keep close to your heart the only condition attached as stated in verse 14: “And if you walk in my ways and keep my statutes...”
