# 5TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME, YEAR C
Theme: Awareness of God’s presence

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 6: 1-2a, 3-8

In the presence of the Almighty God, Isaiah felt unclean, and not worthy to be anywhere near the Lord of Hosts. The same Lord cleansed his lips so that he could respond to the call to be a prophet.

#### 2nd Reading: 1st letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 15: 1-11

Paul acknowledges his nothingness in the presence of the Lord, whose church he had persecuted in the past. He notes that it is by the grace of this same God that he became an Apostle. God can turn the unworthy into instruments of his love.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 5: 1-11

The miraculous catch became the turning point in the life of Simon Peter. The Lord used that event to create the awareness of his presence in him. Peter’s reaction was that of acknowledgement of his sinful nature, and total submission to the Lord.
