# 10TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME: YEAR B
Theme: Evil to be conquered

---

#### 1st Reading; Genesis chapter 3: 9-15

The serpent tricked Adam and Eve into disobeying God’s commandment. The serpent’s evil intentions against man were, however, defeated when God stepped in and pronounced an emphatic curse on the evil one.

#### 2nd Reading: The Second letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 4: 13, to chapter 5: 1

St. Paul encourages us to keep on striving though time (or age) may take its toll on our physical bodies. No matter what happens to us, we should know that we are continually being prepared for eternal glory.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark chapter 3: 20-35

Jesus’ family and friends were slow to understand who he was, and what he had come to do. On the other hand, the Scribes and like-minded persons, who knew Jesus’ worth, chose to blaspheme against him, and by extension, the Holy Spirit, thus denying themselves the privilege to be members of Christ’s family. Christ assures us that all who do the will of God are his family.
