Theme: The profession of faith

---

#### 1st Reading: Deuteronomy, chapter 26: 4-10

The rituals of thanksgiving, as directed by Moses, contain a declaration of faith and absolute trust in God, our creator, the God who transformed the descendants of a wandering shepherd, into a mighty nation.

#### 2nd Reading: Letter of Paul to the Romans, chapter 10: 8-13

St Paul affirms that the profession of our faith, and, consequently, our road to salvation, lies in open confession that Christ is the risen Lord.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 4: 1-13

Jesus shows that knowing and obeying God’s word is the most effective weapon against temptation. Like Jesus, we too can use the power of God’s word to defeat the evil one.
