# FEAST OF THE HOLY FAMILY
Theme: Family life

---

#### 1st Reading: 1 Samuel, chapter 1:20-22, 24-28

God’s gift to Hannah, Samuel, turned out to be Hannah’s gift to God. Children are a gift that sustains a family’s lineage, in much the same way that our way of raising them should be the legacy that fulfills God’s purpose for the family.  
 
#### 2nd Reading: 1st Letter of John, chapter 3: 1-2. 21-24

We are members of God’s family and thus share his Spirit. We remain in this family as long as we play by the divine rules of belief in Christ, obedience to his will, and love for one another.
 
#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 2:41-52

Joseph and Mary did not understand why Jesus chose to stay behind in Jerusalem. Jesus, for his part, did not understand why his earthly parents should worry about him. For our part, we should strive to accept the mystery of Christ’s special mission with unwavering faith.
