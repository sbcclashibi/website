The immediate past chairperson of the church youth council, Mr Anthony Biney, spoke about Laudamus, an annual praise charity festival produced by the youth of St. Bakhita to commemorate Easter. The maiden edition held last year, featuring Gospel greats Joe Mettle and Daughters of Glorious Jesus, brought together over 1,500 faithful to worship God and raise funds for the Legacy of Hope Project.
