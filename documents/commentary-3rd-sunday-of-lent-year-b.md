# 3RD SUNDAY OF LENT YEAR B
Theme: Laws and Worship

---

#### 1st Reading: Exodus, chapter 20: 1 – 17

The Ten Commandments were originally intended for the Jews. For us today, they are a perfect code of behaviour that has been prescribed by a loving and caring father, for his children.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, chapter 1: 22 –25

St Paul addresses all those who either look for signs and wonders, or want a practical and logical explanation of Christian worship. He explains that our common ground for worship must be Christ.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 2: 13 – 25

Jesus drives out those who were putting God’s Temple to wrong use, and predicts his own resurrection. This scripture teaches us that Christ is ever ready to purge our bodies of all evil, and to restore or resurrect them to a condition that will please God.
