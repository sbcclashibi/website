# 6TH SUNDAY OF EASTER YEAR B
Theme: God is Love

---

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles, chapter 10:25-26, 34-35, 44-48

The Holy Spirit came down on Cornelius, a Roman soldier, as well as the other non-Jews who were listening to Peter, even before they were baptized. By this event, we learn, first of all that the Good News of our faith can be shared with everyone, and secondly, that the Holy Spirit can take the initiative and start working in us, whenever he wishes.

#### 2nd Reading: 1st letter of John, chapter 4: 7-10

This scripture explains that we must love one another, because love comes from God, and, indeed, God is love. God showed his love for us by the sacrifice of his only son, through whom we have salvation.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 15:9 -17

Jesus commands us to love one another, as he loved us, and as God loved him. In fact he loves us well enough to teach us everything he received from God, in order that we should become his friends. Jesus urges us this day, to maintain and sustain our love for each other.
