Today is the 2nd Sunday of Advent. All three Readings for today encourage us to have hope, and not to give up. 

- There is hope for those who find themselves in exile.

“Comfort, comfort my people,” says your God (Isaiah 40: 1). The Israelites were in exile, and in great pain, because their freedom was curtailed in the foreign land. God sent the prophet, Isaiah to comfort them, and to assure them that their warfare was over. 

There is the story of a sole survivor of a ship wreck, who was marooned on a lonely island. Actually, at the time the story was told, he was the only resident of the island. He managed to put up a hut for shelter. The hut was gutted by fire one day, and he rained insults on God for bringing such calamity on him. Not long after that, a boat docked on the island, and the sailors informed him that they had seen the smoke signal he had sent out, so they had come to enquire about his concerns.  He had lost all hope of rescue, but God restored his hope through the “calamity” that had visited him. 

You may have had your plans for the year laid out. But, at this time of the year, you have nothing to show for all your efforts. You think you have failed. 

You have thrown your hands in the air in despair, believing you have lost all hope. So was the situation with the Israelites in our 1st Reading. God told them, and is telling us today, that there is hope. This fact is restated in our 2nd Reading (2 Peter 3: 9, 13). Remember this fact as well: a thousand years in God’s sight is like one day; and one day for him is like a thousand years in our sight (2 Peter 3: 8). So, my brother, my sister, just trust in the Lord. Your warfare, your problems etc. have come to an end today. Don’t give up on your plans; there is light at the end of the tunnel.

- Become a messenger of hope, like John the Baptist.

Thomas Edison the prolific inventor, brought home a sealed letter from his teacher. His mum read it and told Thomas what the teacher had written; that he was so intelligent that there was no teacher in the school who could teach him, and so the mum should keep him at home and teach him. Well, Thomas Edison went on to invent several things. Years after the demise of his mum, Thomas chanced upon the letter his teacher had written years earlier. The letter was rather one of dismissal, noting that the boy was mentally ill, and so the school had expelled him.

Thomas’ mum was a messenger of hope to her son. So, next time you look at your electric bulb and electric utility system, listen to recorded sound, watch motion pictures/movies, examine the alkaline family of storage batteries (including your car battery), and about a thousand other inventions, thank God for the life of the mother of Thomas Edison. She was the messenger of hope for her son, and for mankind, through the inventions of her son. 

In salvation history, John the Baptist played a similar role. He preached a baptism of repentance, and thus brought hope to his people and to the whole world (see the Gospel Reading).

As a parent or as a teacher or as a fellow mortal, your words of encouragement can lift up someone from the doldrums, ie, from a state or period of stagnation or depression. The words of the mother of Thomas Edison changed his destiny. There are countless opportunities for you and I to be messengers of hope to others. It is your Christian duty to so do. Pray for the grace to spot such opportunities. Don’t give up on others; they need your helping hand.

- Make your life straight to receive Christ who is coming.

You know how we carefully make preparations for the arrival of a king, or an important personality. Everything must be in topmost condition: the roads are regravelled etc. Even the houses and other structures that line the main road are given some kind of facelift/renovation.

Today, that path that must be made straight is your life. Jesus is the king who is coming. This is the moment to make your path (your life) straight. Remove the stones, twigs and other impediments in your path. Allow Christ to come into your life. Seek his face in the sacraments so your path would be straight.

- Today is the climax of our End of Year Harvest.

Psalm 116: 14 reminds us about an important obligation we have towards our God. Fulfill your vows to the Lord. Do your part, and God will do his. Every pledge you make must be fulfilled. If you have not yet completed payment of the amount you pledged, do not give up. You are alive. You can still do it. Make sure you stay the track, and God will see you through.

Let us go forth this week with the assurance that we are in the company of the Lord whose abiding presence gives us hope.
