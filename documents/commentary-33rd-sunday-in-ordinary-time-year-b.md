# 33RD SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: Hope for a better future.

---

#### 1st Reading: Daniel, chapter 12:1-3

Daniel’s prophecy describes the last days, which would be a period of extreme hardship. God will however send a deliverer to protect his people. The prophecy is therefore a message of hope for those who place their trust in the Lord.

#### 2nd Reading: Hebrews, chapter 10: 11-14, 18

St. Paul writes that Jesus’ sacrifice is the only sacrifice that takes away sins. Our Lord’s sacrifice therefore supersedes all others sacrifices. Christ, our Saviour, shares power with God, and this fact should give hope to all believers.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 13: 24-32

Jesus describes the terrible events that will precede the end times, and how everybody will witness his glorious second coming. Our Lord requires us to observe the signs of the times, and not to speculate on the exact day of his coming.
