Let us examine three issues from the Readings of today.

1. **Be a fruit-bearing Christian**; not just fruit, but good fruit (see the 1st Reading).

Imagine these two scenarios: a parent who has invested a great deal in his children, and a businessman who has established his own company. They both want the best out of their respective investments. The parent expects his children to behave well and become good citizens, while the company owner expects profits and dividends.

Even with all that the parent provided his children, they came out with poor academic records. The businessman also finds out that the company is running alright, but his workers are prospering and living in affluence, while he continues to sweat to keep the company running.

This is the situation in our 1st reading. God is lamenting that he has given us every good thing, yet we are not bearing fruit. We have life, free fresh air, reliable work with which to care for our families, friends, food to eat etc. Yet what kind of fruit are we producing?

Are we producing good fruit for the Lord? Even the newcomers to our faith are more enthusiastic about the Church’s teachings, and are ready to bear the much needed good fruit. Think about it.

What fruit have you produced after your “long stay” in the church, or as a Christian? Bragging about how long you have been baptized is a non-starter.

God is justifiably angry. He has given us everything. He has watered us. He has manured us. He has given us sunshine. What else do we want?

It is amazing that we rather produce fruits of litigation, anger, unrighteousness, among a whole lot of fruits. In fact we are producing “self fruit.”

God is challenging us to look at what he has given us. We must bear fruit; and good fruit as such; fruit that will benefit others.

In the 2nd Reading, St. Paul admonishes us to do the good things we have heard from him: be just people, loving people, righteous people etc. Those are the kinds of fruit God expects us to bear. We cannot afford to fail God, else we lose his protection; we will be exposed to all manner of danger, and that is when we become easy target for the devil.


2. **Do not take God’s generosity for granted.**

In the Gospel Reading, Jesus speaks about a man who planted a vineyard. He expected that the workers would benefit from being employed in the vineyard, while he would also enjoy the fruits of his venture. But we know how the tenants treated those the master sent to check on the progress of work in the vineyard. In more ways than one, he was helping them to earn a living. Their behaviour towards his son, the heir to the farm, is akin to the owner being ejected from his own property.

You may have heard numerous stories about persons who were helped to attain or to achieve something in life, but the beneficiaries of the generous act turned round to steal the limelight from their benefactors; and in some case making the generous fellow look bad in the eyes of the public. 

Sad. But that is the same thing we do when we take God’s generosity for granted. Do not think that the bosses or others are not seeing your ingratitude. The day of reckoning will surely come; you will be given the sack. So also it is with God. When your cup is full, he will sack you from his vineyard, and give it to those who will appreciate his generosity.

3. **A rejected stone can become the cornerstone.**

There are times when we look down on people for reasons best known to ourselves, but often including where the person comes from. Even a person’s name could ring unpleasant bells in some peoples’ ears.

If, for example someone is not performing well academically, he might be a star in other areas.

The story is told of a physically challenged young man and his two able-bodied siblings. Their parents discriminated against the poor lad because of his physical impairment, but lavished all their love on the other two. They would spell out the kind of professions and comfortable lives that beckoned the two. 

Things did not go well with the two who were pampered, because they fell into bad company and ended up as social misfits.

The physically challenged lad had tremendous skills in athletics. He made it to the paralympics, where he won a gold medal.

Guess what? He became a household name. Fame brought him wealth, and he, the rejected one, became the cornerstone of the family. The rest is history.

Be careful not to despise any person. Tomorrow, he may be your safety valve.

The people of Israel, especially the Scribes and the Pharisees rejected Jesus, but he became the cornerstone of mankind’s salvation. Refrain from looking down on or rejecting people because of ethnicity, colour etc. You are not God. When the tides turn, you will not like it. Treat people well. Always.

We pray that God will help us to bear good fruit. We pray that he will help us so we do not take his generosity for granted. We pray that God will help us to not look down on any of our fellow beings.
