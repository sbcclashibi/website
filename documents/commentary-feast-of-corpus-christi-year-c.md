# THE BODY AND BLOOD OF CHRIST (CORPUS CHRISTI) YEAR C
Theme: Sharing life with Christ

---

#### 1st Reading:  Genesis, Chapter 14: 18-20

Melchizedek, a God-loving King and priest, offered Abram bread and wine, an act which is symbolic of the Holy Eucharist as we know it today.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, Chapter 11:23-26

Paul invites us to focus on the real meaning of the Eucharist. The Body and Blood of our Lord signifies oneness with him and togetherness with fellow believers.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, Chapter 9:11b-17

The feeding of the crowd with five loaves and two fish shows that even if we, like the disciples, do not have the resources with which to feed or tend the Lord’s sheep, Jesus is ever ready to place his miracles at our disposal.
