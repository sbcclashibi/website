# EASTER SUNDAY
Theme: The Lord has indeed risen 

---

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles, chapter 10: 34a, 37 - 43 

Peter’s homily summarises what the Gospel is all about: that is, Jesus’ perfect life of servanthood, his death on the cross, his resurrection, his fulfillment of the scriptures, and the imperative need for each of us to have personal faith in him, for our salvation.

#### 2nd Reading: Colossians, chapter 3: 1 - 4 

The implication of having been resurrected with Christ is that we should no longer be pre-occupied with the petty things of this life; rather we should focus on our heavenly inheritance.

*OR* 

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, chapter 5: 6b - 8 

St Paul challenges us to celebrate Christ’s resurrection with a new mind-set that is based on Christ-centred values. 

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 20: 1 - 9 

Mary Magdalene, Simon Peter and the other disciple, must have rushed to the tomb with mixed feelings. They found out, as we also do by faith, that Christ is risen!

*OR*

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 28: 1 - 10 

In the scenario of an earthquake, an angel rolling away the stone, trembling guards and other frightening incidents, it is reassuring for the two Marys, the disciples and, indeed, all Christendom, that Christ is risen!
