#### 1st Reading: Daniel, chapter 7: 9 - 10, 13 - 14

The prophet Daniel saw a vision of God seated in majesty, and multitudes worshiping him. God then handed over to his Son dominion over all creation; a kingship that would last forever.

#### 2nd Reading: Second letter of Peter, chapter 1:16 - 19

Peter admonishes us to take all that the Apostles witnessed about the Lord as authentic and credible, since they were eyewitnesses to the Transfiguration.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 17: 1 - 9

We share the experiences of Peter, James and John in the Transfiguration event. God clearly identifies Jesus as his son and our Saviour. Children of God must listen to him.
