Lessons from the 1st Reading and the Gospel Reading.

#### 1. Treat the House of God as a place of prayer.

In years gone by, you would remove your footwear before entering the church, as a sign of reverence to the house of God. These days we dishonour the house of God in a lot of ways, such as by TikToking, Facebooking, chewing gum and littering, while others are praying. It appears there are some who cannot take a second off their phones, even when they are in church, let alone give only two hours of their twenty-four God-given hours to appreciate him! Someone was even busy betting on his phone. What will this fellow tell his friends about what he heard in church?

In the 1st Reading, we hear that “….my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples.”(Isaiah 56: 7). The moment we step foot in the house of God, we should know that it is time to set everything else aside, sit, pray and prepare ourselves for the celebration of the Mass. You are in the house of God; a house of prayer.

#### 2. The house of God should be a house of refuge for all.
 These include those who are seen as foreigners (see Isaiah 56: 6). So, the house of God is a place for all people, not some people. Remember the priest who disguised himself with tattered clothes and took a seat at the entrance of the church? There were those who jeered at him, while others ordered him out of their sights. He somehow found his way to the sanctuary, and began taking off his tattered clothes one piece after the other. When he was done, the congregation recognized him as their pastor. His word to the wide-eyed, opened-mouth congregation was: “Today, this is my homily.”

Do not push anyone away just because s/he does not meet your personal criteria for acceptance into the midst of God’s people. Welcome everyone.

#### 3. Persevere till you reach your goal.
The Canaanite woman in the Gospel Reading did just that. Don’t give up. Push! Press on till you get there. Even the disciples begged Jesus to send her away! But she persisted! 

Don’t pray once, twice or so, and throw your hands in despair. That’s certainly not the way to go. You don’t even need to keep a tally of the number of prayers you offer.

#### 4. Grab any opportunity that comes your way.
Carpe diem! Seize the day! There were many sick people in the territory, but the child of the Canaanite woman was the one who was healed. She seized the day.

And there was this man who, after several months of frustrations he experienced while trying to see a “big man” with a project proposal, took his chance when he met the “big man” at a wedding. The rest, they say, is history.

Be prepared always. You don’t know when you’ll get your breakthrough. The Canaanite woman, once again. She heard that Jesus was going to pass her way, so she took the chance, and obtained healing for her daughter.

Listen to the words of wisdom when they are being offered to someone else; they are meant for you as well. Through his teaching, Jesus gives us opportunities every day, like the gift of this day. Ours is to seize the moment the opportunity presents itself.

May this week be a week of blessing to us all.
