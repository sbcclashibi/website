Theme: The need for ongoing reform

#### 1st Reading: Exodus, chapter 3:1-8a, 13-15

Moses encountered God in the Burning Bush at a time when he probably did not imagine that God could be so near. The unchanging God is as near to us this day, as he always has been to his people.

#### 2nd Reading: 1st letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 10: 1-6, 10-12

St Paul is reminding us that the events in the bible are neither hearsay nor are they meant for fun. Godâ€™s word is meant to inform and to teach us, so that we may avoid the pitfalls of our ancestors.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 13: 1-9

Jesus explains that misfortunes could befall anyone at any time. It is important to ensure that in case of eventualities, we would have died as repentant souls, or as trees that were fruitful when they had the chance to do so.
