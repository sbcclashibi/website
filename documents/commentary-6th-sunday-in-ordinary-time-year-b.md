# 6TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: Spiritually unclean

---

#### 1st Reading: Leviticus, chapter 13: 1-2, 44-46.

The law concerning leprosy emphasises that a leper is unclean and an outcast, and must be treated as such. From this analogy, we notice that sin leads to spiritual leprosy, and the only way we can be made clean is to turn to God.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, chapter 10: 31, to chapter 11:1.

St. Paul encourages us to imitate the Lord Jesus, who was considerate and showed empathy to all. We should not hurt the feelings of others. Above all, we should do all things to the glory of God.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 1:40-45

Jesusâ€™ attitude towards the leper was entirely different from what the Old Testament rules prescribed. Christ actually touched him, and healed him. To Jesus, no one is an outcast.
