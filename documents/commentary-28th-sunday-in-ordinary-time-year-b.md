# 28TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: Renunciation and stewardship.

---

#### 1st Reading: Wisdom, chapter 7: 7-11

Wisdom from God is portrayed as better than thrones, riches or even good health. He who chooses divine wisdom receives every good gift from God.

#### 2nd Reading: Hebrews, chapter 4: 12-13

Godâ€™s life-changing word permeates every part of our being. We Christians must endeavour to allow this living word to mold our lives.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 10: 17-30

Observance of the commandments is no guarantee for salvation. Obeying the orders of Christ, which may imply placing our resources at the disposal of others, is what the Saviour requires of us.
