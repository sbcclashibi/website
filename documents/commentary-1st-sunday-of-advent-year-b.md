# 1ST SUNDAY OF ADVENT YEAR B
Theme: Stay Awake!

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 63: 16b-17, 19b and chapter 64:2-7

After their return from the Babylonian exile, the Israelites still faced difficulties. They ask God to intervene to save them. We can take a cue from the Responsorial Psalm, and make a similar plea for mercy.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, chapter 1:3-9

St. Paul writes that God has blessed us with words as well as with knowledge and spiritual gifts. God will surely repay our faithfulness as we await the coming of his Son, Jesus Christ.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 13:33-37

Jesus uses the parable we are about to hear, to remind us that each of us has a role to play while he is away in heaven. If we are to avoid any embarrassment on his second coming, then we must obey our Lordâ€™s command to be on our guard.
