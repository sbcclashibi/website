# 20TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR C
Theme: Can we stand correction?

---

#### 1st Reading: Jeremiah, Chapter 38: 4-6, 8-10

Like Jeremiah, those who stand up against the standards of the flesh are at risk of condemnation by the powers that be. God is, however, ever ready to deliver them from their foes.

#### 2nd Reading: Hebrews, Chapter 12:1-4

St. Paul compares our call to be Christians to running a race. We must remain focused on Christ, our coach, and what he went through for us, so we do not give up.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, Chapter 12:49-53

Jesus says that our decision to follow him might entail giving up even close relationships. All the same, our Saviour demands a clear-cut response from us.
