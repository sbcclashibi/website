# 5TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: He heals the broken-hearted

---

#### 1st Reading: Job, chapter 7: 1-4, 6-7

Job paints a rather sad picture of the human condition, which is endless suffering, and hopelessness. In contrast, the psalmist assures us that there is hope in the Lord. We are invited to praise the Lord, for he heals all who are suffering.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, chapter 9: 16-19, 22-23.

St. Paul considers it his duty to preach the gospel, without seeking reward. His motivation is that those who hear him might be saved, and that he, in turn, would share in the blessings that come with doing God’s work.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 1: 29-39.

Jesus’ healing ministry, “The Personal Touch”, was an entirely new experience for the ancient Hebrews. The Lord combined preaching with healing, such that the many who were healed by him received the Good News as well.
