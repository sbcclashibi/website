# 26TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR C
Theme: “They have Moses and the prophets. Let them hear them”

---

#### 1st Reading: Amos, Chapter 6: 1a, 4-7

The prophet Amos criticises the lack of compassion by the wealthy for the poor in our society. With time, he says, their wealth would be a thing of the past.

#### 2nd Reading: 1Timothy, Chapter 6: 11-16

Paul reminds Timothy, and all of us, to live virtuous lives and to continually renew our baptismal vows until the end of time.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, Chapter 16: 19-31

The fate that befell the rich man in the parable should remind us that those who are the most insignificant socially may be the ones who have a value in God’s kingdom. It is unwise to ignore the Lazarus in our community.
