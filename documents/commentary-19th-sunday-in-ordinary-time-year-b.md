# 19TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME
Theme: Christ our viaticum, food for our journey.

---

#### 1st Reading; 1 Kings 19: 4-8

The prophet Elijah was forced by circumstances to flee for his life. While on his way through the desert, God fed him, and so he had enough strength to walk forty days and forty nights to his destination. God’s message for us is that he will provide us all that we need to strengthen us on our way to him.

#### 2nd Reading: Ephesians 4: 30-5:2

St Paul advises that we should not offend the Holy Spirit in whom we have been sealed. There should be no ill-feeling within and amongst us, but rather we should emulate the love of Christ and the compassion of God.

#### Gospel Reading: John 6: 41-51

The Jews did not accept Christ’s claim to be the Bread of Life that came down from heaven, through whom mankind would have everlasting life. All that Jesus is saying to us is that if we allow him to fill every part of our being, we will never be alienated from God.
