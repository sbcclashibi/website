# 32ND SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: Self-giving to God.

---

#### 1st Reading:  Kings, chapter 17: 10-16

By the example of the widow of Zarephath, we learn that when we generously give of ourselves, no matter how little, our gift is precious in God’s eye. It shall not go unrewarded.

#### 2nd Reading: Hebrews, chapter 9: 24-28

St Paul places Christ’s sacrifice in its proper context: the context of Christ himself, as High Priest, entering the heavenly sanctuary with his own blood, his very life, as atonement for the sins of all mankind.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 12: 38-44

The poor widow gave to God all that she had, out of generosity. Jesus commends this kind of self-giving, and cautions us against actions that are done only to attract attention.
