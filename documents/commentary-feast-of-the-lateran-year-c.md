# THE DEDICATION OF THE LATERAN BASILICA IN ROME
Theme: Christians are God’s living temple

---

#### 1st Reading: Ezekiel, Chapter 47: 1-2, 8-9, 12

The water flowing from the temple in all directions, bringing life, freshness and nourishment to all things in its way symbolises what mankind would experience in the new life that Christ brings.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, Chapter 3: 9c-11, 16-17

Paul emphatically states that Jesus Christ is the foundation upon which we, the people of God, are building. The kind of building we put up will be put to the test on judgment day.

#### Gospel Reading: John, Chapter 2: 13 – 22

Jesus drives out those who were putting God’s Temple to wrong use and predicts his resurrection. What this scripture teaches us is that Christ is ever ready to purge our bodies of all evil and to restore or resurrect them to a condition that will please God.
