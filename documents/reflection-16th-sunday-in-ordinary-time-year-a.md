Today’s 1st Reading and the Gospel Reading teach us about patience. If you are not patient, you will make big mistakes.

There is the story of a woman who did not have enough money to buy a bag for her daughter who was going to school for the first time. The bag seller took what she had, and gave her the bag. Somehow, she left the new bag in the vehicle she had boarded when she was returning home. She went back to the station to enquire from the driver, his mate and others, who all said that they had not seen the bag. Well, with her patience completely ran out, she cursed all those who had seen the bag, or had touched it. They fell ill under the curse, and died one after the other. The woman in the story had also seen the bag, and had touched it. Did the curse affect her? It did, sadly. Because of her impatience, she cursed everybody, including herself. Let us be patient in all things.

Out of patience, God created the world in seven days. He could have done it in a twinkle of an eye, but he preferred to be patient. 

Our elders say that if you are patient, you can dissect an insect and see its intestines.  Be patient, because we all are different. We can learn from each other if we are patient. Even with your own plans, be patient, and you will see them come to fruition.

The Gospel Reading is also about the need to be patient. The sower asked his servants to be patient until both the wheat and the weeds grow together. At the right time, it would be easy to pull out the weeds, without uprooting the wheat.

Patience! That is God for us! With patience, he governs all things. He is encouraging us to be patient with one another, because we are not equal. 

Do not be discouraged because of your small beginnings. This is the story of the mustard seed, which, though is the smallest among the seeds, grows into a huge tree, providing shelter, and nesting places for birds. The important thing is to start something. Where you are is immaterial; move forward, continue patiently to your destination.

Another point to note is that we all have enemies. People will hate you for no apparent reason, even if they are seeing you for the first time. If we allow ourselves to be controlled by our enemies, that is where we fall into trouble. Jesus’ parable is telling us not to pay attention to the enemy so we can remain focused. At the end of the day, the enemy (the weeds) were cut and burnt. So shall it be onto the enemy.

Today, the 16th Sunday in Ordinary Time, we celebrate our elderly people. It is good to call them, or better still, be with them, to show them how valuable they are to us. Pope Francis urges us to keep them in our minds always.

Let us remember always that we have to be and remain patient. We can then be focused and move forward, like the mustard seed. We should not pay attention to the distractive ways and means of the enemy, so things would go in our favour. 

Finally, let us keep the elderly in our prayers; this gesture attracts great rewards.
