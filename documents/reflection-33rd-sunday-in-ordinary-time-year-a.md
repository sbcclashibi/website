It is another day, and another opportunity to glorify God, and to put our talents to good use.

The priest recalls a conversation he had with a nine-year-old boy. The boy asked questions such as why Father was not married; why he had no children, and the kind of woman he would have loved to marry. It was the turn of Father to ask the young boy questions, which included the type of woman he (the boy) would marry. The little boy had his answers ready, as a matter of fact. 

1. Go beyond the physical.

The little boy’s answers reflect how we perceive things most of the time. We tend to focus on the physical and so block other issues that may go into making the right choices or taking the right decisions. It certainly holds true when we are assessing eligible candidates who would become our spouses.
Today’s 1st Reading pays a glowing tribute to the ideal spouse. “Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain.” (Proverbs 31: 30). The real beauty of the ideal wife has more to do with the resourcefulness with which she deploys her talents in order to reinforce her marriage, than physical attraction which tends to heavily influence on our choice.

2. Don’t bury or hide your talent.

Sometimes, one word from a critic or naysayer will discourage you. Don’t be like the servant who was given one talent.
Most of us hide our talents. We bury them and go and copy another person’s talent. It won’t work, because that talent is not yours. Don’t be afraid of those who wish that you fail. Remember, they are the same people who will turn round and praise you when you succeed. The world recognizes those who excel when they use their talents. Parents can learn from this and actively encourage their children to develop their talents.

3. Work with your talent for the benefit of mankind.

We can name several personalities such as sportsmen, entertainers/musicians and inventors. We are beneficiaries of their talents. If they had kept their capabilities to themselves, civilization, as we know it today, may only be an unrealizable dream. Soccer legends Pele and Maradonna are dead and gone. Their legacy lives on. Ronaldo and Messi are alive, and have already written their names in the history books. The world awaits your talent. Put it to good use.

4. Prepare to give account of your God-given talents or gifts.

Your talent is a gift. If you don’t use the gift, the one who gave it to you will take it back.

The Bible is clear on this when Jesus says: “So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten.” (Matthew 25: 28).
If Jesus Christ comes today and says that he is not judging you according to your sins, but by how you used your talent, will there be cause for him to say to you: “You wicked and sloth servant!…” (Matthew 25: 26). Will Christ take you to heaven, or you will end up in hell?

The 2nd Reading tells us that the Lord will come again. That is certain. 

Will you be counted among the good and faithful servants who would be invited to enter into the joy of the master? (Matthew 25: 21, 23).
