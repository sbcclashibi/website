Theme: Racing to grasp the prize

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 43: 16-21

This scripture admonishes us not to be fixated on the past even if we saw God’s hand at work in our lives. The same mighty God is doing something entirely new in our lives. Our part is to remain optimistic.

#### 2nd Reading: Letter of Paul to the Philippians, chapter 3: 8-14

St Paul summarises his personal convictions in the statement that all he had achieved so far was nothing, compared to the reward that awaits him. Paul’s values should spur us on towards our heavenly goal.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 8: 1-11

Jesus offers an opportunity to the Pharisees and all of us, to mend our ways. His words to the woman: “Go, and sin no more”, should forever ring in our hearts, and remain etched on our minds.
