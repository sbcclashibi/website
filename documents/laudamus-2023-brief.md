# Laudamus 2023

**Laudamus** is an annual charity praise festival curated by the youth of St. Bakhita Catholic Church, Community 20, Tema, as part of activities to climax the Easter celebrations in our church. 

Established in 2022, the praise festival is designed to provide an audience from diverse faiths with a unique Christian religious experience of praise and worship in a serene, secured and spiritually uplifting environment, while offering each person the opportunity to support a charity project with their widow's mite.

#### "Let all that you do, be done in love"
The theme for this year's event is taken from 1 Corinthians 16:14, which read "Let allthat you do, be done in love". We believe that it is our duty as people of faith to spread love across the world, and so, this year's theme is a call to all attendees to share some love with their neighbours and the environment.

#### 2023 Charity Project
In 2022 our charity project was in support of the construction of a world-class Paediatric and Child Cancer Specialist Hospital listed under the Legacy of Hope projects introduced by the Metropolitan Catholic Archbishop of Accra, Most Rev. John Bonaventure Kwofie.

This year our focus is to assist developmental works at the Catholic Not-For-Profit rehabilitation and treatment outfit, House of St. Francis Rehab Centre, a peer-driven residential treatment facility located in Ashaiman. House of St. Francis provides care and support for both male and female clients recovering from alcohol and drug addictions.

Established  in 2012, House of St. Francis meets the needs of between 170 to 190 clients annually with admirable success stories recorded. According to WHO data published in 2020, drug-use deaths in Ghana reached 630, or 0.36% of total deaths recorded. the data ranked Ghana #22 in the world.

While we raise funds to support the rehab center, we shall engage in a drive to raise awareness on drug abuse and its related issues.
