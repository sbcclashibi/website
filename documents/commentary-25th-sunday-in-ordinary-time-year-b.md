# 25th SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME
Theme: Church management is service.

---

#### 1st Reading: Wisdom, chapter 2: 12, 17-20

This scripture describes the fate that often befalls the just and upright man. He is under constant attack by his opponents who find fault with his principles. God will, indeed, protect him.

#### 2nd Reading: James, chapter 3:16, to chapter 4: 3

St James traces the source of conflict among the congregation to attitudes such as envy and jealousy. The antidote for such tendencies is prayer for divine wisdom, which brings peace as a dividend.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 9:30-37

While Jesus was concerned with his last days on earth, his disciples were preoccupied with the ideas of personal greatness. Jesus teaches them, and all of us, that in spite of our personal ambitions, greatness, by Godâ€™s standards, comes from service.
