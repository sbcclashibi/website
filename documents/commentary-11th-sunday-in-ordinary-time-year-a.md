# 11TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR A
Theme: God’s kindness endures forever
---

#### 1st Reading: The Book of Exodus, Chapter 19: 2 – 6a

God reminds the Israelites about how he purposefully brought them out of bondage in Egypt, into freedom with him. To the Israelites, and all of us who believe in him, our loyalty to him will ensure that we remain God’s most treasured possession.

#### 2nd Reading: St Paul’s letter to the Romans, Chapter 5: 6 – 11

Being made to undergo punishment for the crimes of others is as painful an experience as it is outrageously unjust. Yet God proves his love for us by making his sinless son, Jesus Christ, die for our sins. Beloved, we must appreciate Christ’s sacrifice for us.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, Chapter 9: 36, to Chapter 10: 8

God’s loving care for us is demonstrated in Christ’s compassion for the crowd. Jesus calls the Twelve to bring pathways to salvation to us his people, his harvest.
