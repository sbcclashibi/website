# 3RD SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME, YEAR C
Theme: God’s Living Word in the Bible

---

#### 1st Reading: Nehemiah, chapter 8: 2-4a, 5-6, 8-10

Scripture recounts what happened as the congregation listened to Ezra. Like all people of God, we are to listen actively to the word as it is read, absorb it wholeheartedly as it is explained and add a resounding “Amen!” as we affirm our acceptance of the word.

#### 2nd Reading: 1st letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 12: 12-30

St Paul reminds us that although we may be different from each other in several ways, we are all parts of the one body of Jesus Christ, in the same way that the human body is made up of many parts. We are to complement each other’s talents and abilities.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 1: 1-4, and chapter 4: 14-21

St Luke places Jesus in the context of prophecy, as recorded by those who witnessed the events unfold. At the end of his narration, we hear how Jesus himself fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah about himself.
