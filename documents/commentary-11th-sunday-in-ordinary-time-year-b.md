Theme: Hope.

---

#### 1st Reading: Ezekiel, chapter 17: 22-24

Ezekiel carries a message of hope to all God’s people. As a point of reference, he describes how God will take a seemingly weak part of a tree, and transform it into a magnificent tree.

#### 2nd Reading: 2 Corinthians, chapter 5: 6-10

Paul’s message of hope is expressed in his confidence that faith in Christ positions us for faithful service. The reward for our faith, which is eternal life with Christ, is worth the waiting.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 4: 26-34

Jesus likens the reign of God to the process of sowing a seed and watching it grow to full maturity. This process, like following in the footsteps of Christ, requires patience and a living hope.
