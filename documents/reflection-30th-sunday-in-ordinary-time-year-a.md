**Don’t forget who you are in any situation. Don’t forget who you are in Christ.**

We may forget ourselves in a lot of situations, such as in our jobs and other concerns. But don’t forget: we are children of Christ. I am a child of God, and I have the love of God in me.

The slogan for our church for this year is: “Let all you do be done in Love” (1 Corinthians 16: 14). It means that what we do in church must be extended to our actions outside the church environment. Often times when we are taken out of the church or religious environment, we forget who we are. Don’t forget you are a child of God. That is who you are. And so any moment we encounter others they should know, by our deeds, that we are God’s children. 

In our 1st Reading, God tells his people how to live their lives with him, and with one another: with children, widows, the poor, the orphans and strangers. What God is saying to us is: “As you deal with me, so shall you deal with others.”

In the Gospel Reading we read that the Pharisees sent a representative to Jesus to ask him what the greatest commandment was (Matthew 22: 35). This was a genuine question, because they had so entangled themselves with several embellishments of the law that they could no longer see their way clear. So they expected everyone to go along with the confusion they had been peddling.

If Jesus were to pick any one of their several interpretations of the law, they would have accused him of diverse errors of commission and omission. Jesus’ response went beyond what their minds were thinking. He brought them back to the basics of how God wants us to love. Love God, yes; but love your neighbour as yourself (Matthew 22: 39). In other words, love of God and love of neighbour are inseparable.

We know, through our Christian upbringing, this scripture: “Love your neighbour as yourself.” But do we care about one another? It is always “Me, Myself and I.” No one else matters. We take, in fact, claim all advantages for ourselves, clearly ignoring anyone else. By so doing (or behaving), we set aside God’s command to love our neighbour as we love ourselves.

Today we complain about the ills in our society, such as bribery, corruption, and nepotism. Ironically, we easily forget that we are the same people who are perpetrating these vices. 

Let us look at this scenario: We start preparations for Sunday Mass well ahead of time, say, Saturday evening. We carefully select the clothes we would wear for the Mass. Throughout the week, we may attend Mass in different attires, and perhaps with different measures of preparation. This is normal. But does it mean that our posturing for Mass on a Sunday should be different from how we conduct ourselves on other days of the week?

The 1st Reading reminds God’s people that they were once strangers in someone else’s land. We are strangers, too. The Gospel exhorts us to love others. And in the 2nd Reading, St. Paul praises the Thessalonians that they had received the word of God, and were living it. It is common knowledge among all the people around them, St. Paul tells them, that they were living the word of God. Can the same thing be said about us, brothers and sisters?

It is all too easy for us to forget who we are, and are prone to things like uttering careless words, and indulging in acts that do not reflect God’s love in us. For example, there should not be any occasion when we would be compelled to check ourselves because we are behaving inappropriately in the presence of, say, our Priest, who we could not make out because he was in mufti, or anyone who does not seem to matter in our lives. We don’t have to act “piously” only when we are in church or in a religious setting. We must check ourselves often so that there would be no near occasion for us to act or live contrary to the command of God.  And when we so do, we won’t forget who we are.

Sometimes, it is our weaknesses as humans that prevent us from living as God willed, and forgetting that we have a life in Christ. Let us, therefore, seek the face of God, for the grace of God to shield us from that which makes us disobey his commandments. As God did for the Thessalonians so they were able to live the faith, he will do same for us. When we live by the instructions of God, the praises shall be unto him.
