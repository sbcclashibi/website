# 21ST SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: The risk of faith.

---

#### 1st Reading: Joshua, chapter 24: 1-2a, 15-17, 18b

At Shechem, Joshua and the Israelites renewed their covenant with God, vowing to serve him, because they were witnesses to his miracles. The Lord’s protective presence belongs to us as well, if we choose to serve him unconditionally.

#### 2nd Reading: Ephesians, chapter 5: 21-32

Paul compares the unity that exists between Christ and his church, to the love between a husband and his wife. It is a love borne out of faith which often defies logic. Christ’s love for us cannot always be explained, and therefore it is pointless for us to analyse.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 6: 60-69

The disciples who turned their backs on Christ obviously had their faith shaken by his teachings. Peter’s response sums up the sentiment of the genuine followers: Jesus has the words of everlasting life.
