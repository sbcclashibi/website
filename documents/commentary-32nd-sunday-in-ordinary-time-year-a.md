# 32ND SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR A
Theme: Wisdom and death

#### 1st Reading: Wisdom, chapter 6: 12 - 16

Wisdom enables us to understand all situations perfectly and also to have peace of mind. Those who love wisdom and look for her, will find her, because wisdom also looks for those who are worthy of her.

#### 2nd Reading: 1Thessalonians, chapter 4: 13 - 18

This scripture answers the question about rising from the dead, and the Lord’s second coming. The answer lies in our living faith that we shall be with the Lord at all times.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 25: 1 - 13

The parable of the ten young women is about two classes of people: the wise ones who were ready, and the others who were not ready when the groom arrived. God’s word for us today is that we should be prepared to wait on our Lord at any time.
