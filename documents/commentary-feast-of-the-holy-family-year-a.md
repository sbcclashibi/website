# FEAST OF HOLY FAMILY
Theme: Family Life

---

#### 1st Reading: Sirach, chapter 3:2-6, 12 – 14

The timeless message of this scripture is that those who honour their parents shall be abundantly blessed by God.  Our duties and obligations towards our parents can atone for our sins.

#### 2nd Reading: Paul’s letter to the Colossians, chapter 3: 12 – 21

The first part of this reading speaks about how we can use Christian virtues such as kindness, humility, patience and love to nurture harmonious relationships among ourselves.

In the second part St. Paul outlines the complimentary roles of husbands, wives and children in promoting and maintaining a happy family life.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 2: 13-15, 19-23

The Lord God shielded the Holy Family from those who sought to destroy it. God’s message to us is that he will go to great lengths to protect his own.
