#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 53: 10-11

The true servant of God is he who offers everything that he has, including his own life, for the benefit of others.

#### 2nd Reading: Hebrews, chapter 4: 14-16

Jesus Christ empathizes with our predicament. He understands our human failings and weaknesses, and so we can turn to him confidently and trustingly in all situations.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 10: 35-45

Jesus makes it clear that greatness is not derived from the position we occupy, nor does it come with exercising authority by intimidation. Greatness comes from stooping to serve our subjects.
