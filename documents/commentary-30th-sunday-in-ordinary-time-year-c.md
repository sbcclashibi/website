# 30TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR C
Theme: The prayer of the lowly pierces the clouds

---

#### 1st Reading Sirach, Chapter 35: 12-14, 16-18

Scripture says that God treats all of us equally and fairly, but he pays particular attention to the needs of the deprived and downtrodden.

#### 2nd Reading: 2 Timothy, Chapter 4: 6-8, 16-18

This event in the life of St Paul teaches us that when we are lonely or feel rejected, we should not be dejected. We should find strength in prayer.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, Chapter 18: 9-14

Jesus condemns the self-righteousness of the Pharisee. The lesson for us is that he whose prayer is acceptable to God, is the one who approaches the Most High in humility.
