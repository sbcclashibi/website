# 3RD SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR A
Theme: Discipleship

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 8: 23, to chapter 9: 3

In the past, God punished his people for their sins. Now he has brought them relief, so that they would be full of joy without measure.

#### 2nd Reading: The First letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 1: 10–13, 17

St. Paul sounds a word of caution against certain divisive tendencies in the congregation at Corinth. For him, what should matter to us Christians is the message of Christ which enjoins all of us to a common discipleship.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 4: 12 – 23

Jesus begins his missionary activities, as prophesied by Isaiah, to bring hope to a people without hope. All followers of Christ are called to our Lord’s ministry: to bring joy and light to all men.
