# 23RD SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: The healing activity of our Lord.

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 35: 4-7a

This scripture teaches that human beings are afflicted by all kinds of spiritual ailments. However, at the coming of the Messiah, the blind will see, the deaf will hear; streams will flow from the desert. These are some of the miracles that the Lord will perform when he comes.

#### 2nd Reading: James, chapter 2:1-5

St James advises the believer against the tendency to discriminate against our fellow men. He says that God did not show any partiality when he chose us, and for that matter, we should not indulge in favoritism.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 7:31-37

Jesus heals a man who was deaf and dumb. The Lord’s command: “Be opened!” is a command unto every believer’s spiritual sickness. And when we are cured, we can gratefully say, like the friends of the man who was healed, that, “Indeed, the Lord has done everything well!”
