# 5th Sunday of Easter
_Lessons from the 1st Reading: Acts 6: 1-7 (from the Homily of Rev Fr Hillary Agbenosi)_

---

1.	Growth comes with obstacles. When you start growing, things change. The church started growing: "3000 were added in a single day" (Acts 2:41). Also, in Acts 4:4, "5000 disciples were added" and in Acts 2:47, "the Lord added to the number". <br><br>The challenges they faced included perceived discrimination and the distraction as to whether the apostles should focus on preaching or the distribution of food.

2.	Challenges create opportunities for growth. The apostles rose to the occasion and appointed seven men to sort out the other matters. You must adapt to resolve problems. Leave your comfort zone, brother and sister, so you can move forward.

3.	Working together achieves a lot. Great things can be accomplished when we work together. Acts 6:7 says: Preaching flourished, the number of disciples multiplied greatly. A large group of priests became obedient to the faith. 

These are but a few outcomes when the principles of good leadership are applied in changing/challenging circumstances: in the home, in business, in government etc.
