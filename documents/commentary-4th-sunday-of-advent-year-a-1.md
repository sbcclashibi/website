Theme: Faith

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 7: 10 – 14

Although King Ahaz refused to ask God for an intervention, our Creator went ahead to show him a sign. The message for us is that even when we set God aside, he goes out of his way to demonstrate his steadfast love for us.

#### 2nd Reading: Paul’s letter to the Romans, chapter 1: 1 – 7

Paul used his salutation to the Romans as an opportunity to explain that our Saviour is both man and God, and that it is through him that God calls us to himself.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 1: 18 – 24

God entrusted a responsibility to Joseph, a righteous man. God was with him, as the name of the child implies. God is, indeed, with all who walk in his ways.
