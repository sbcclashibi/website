# 1ST SUNDAY OF LENT YEAR B
Theme: Overcoming the Powers of Evil.

#### 1st Reading: Genesis, chapter 9: 8 - 15

God made a new covenant with Noah and his descendants, as well as the creatures that survived the flood. God remembers and keeps his promises, and so we too must fulfill our part by overcoming evil in all its forms.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Peter, chapter 3: 18 – 22

Peter compares the cleansing of the earth by the floodwaters, to our own cleansing through baptism. He explains that our baptism will be of no use if we do not live our baptismal vows.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 1: 12 – 15

Jesus spent forty days and forty nights in the desert, overcoming all temptations and threats of the devil. Our observance of Lent must ultimately predispose us to the empowerment by the Holy Spirit to be victorious, like our Saviour.
