#### 1st Reading: Deuteronomy, chapter 4: 1-2, 6-8

After Moses had given God’s law to the Israelites, he cautioned them not to add to, nor subtract from them. Through careful observance of the law, he notes, all other nations will acknowledge the wisdom, intelligence and greatness of their nation, Israel, which has God as its Lord.

#### 2nd Reading: James, chapter 1: 17-18, 21b-22 & 27

This scripture stresses that the word of God is a genuine gift from heaven, freely given by God, our father. The believer is expected to receive this gift by faith, because it is the source of our salvation. We are required to go beyond mere listening to the word; we must live the word of God.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 7: 1-8, 14-15, 21-23

Jesus set the records straight as regards what is pure and what is impure in the sight of God. Man becomes impure when he relegates God’s commandments to the background. Secondly, it is the ungodly thoughts which we entertain in our hearts and minds, such as greed and arrogance that make us impure.
