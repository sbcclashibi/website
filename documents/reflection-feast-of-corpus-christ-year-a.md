1. When we celebrate the Mass, we come to receive God himself, in his totality.

2. Trans-substantiation occurs, ie, there is a transformation of bread into the Body of Christ, and there is transformation of wine into the Blood of Christ. There are several Eucharistic miracles which confirm that it is indeed the Body and Blood of Christ that we consume when we receive Holy Communion.

3. At the Last Supper (Matthew 26: 28), Christ took bread and declared: “This is my Body……” Christ did not say “This is like my Body…..” He did not mince words when he said that the bread and the wine are his Body and his Blood.

4. In John chapter 6, Jesus teaches extensively about his Body and Blood. “I am the bread of life,” he asserts. He makes several references to his Body and Blood, which is essential for our life, on our journey to eternity.

5. Many people, today, like the Jews of old, still doubt what Jesus said about eating his Body and drinking his Blood. The Greek translation of the scripture reads something like: “Unless you chew my Body…..” No doubt the Jews reacted the way they did; and their like, today, still resist this compulsory condition that was established by Christ himself. They found this teaching hard.

6. He asked the skeptics: “Does this offend you?” They, surely, were offended, and quit following the Lord. Jesus did not try to persuade or convince them to rescind their decision (John 6: 61-66). We notice in the next verse, v. 67, he asked the Twelve, probably, coolly, but firmly: “Do you also want to go away?” We can sense that Jesus was emphatic; no compromise, no middle ground.

7. St Paul, no doubt, understands what is meant by the Body and Blood of Christ, when he asked in our 1st Reading (1 Corinthians 10:16): “The cup of blessing that we drink, is it not the Blood of Christ?”

The believer is cautioned against complacency when it comes to matters concerning the Body and Blood of Christ. Let us carefully consider the following as well:

1. If it is Jesus Christ who comes down onto the altar when we celebrate the Mass, then we must know that God dwells here. We must genuflect before the tabernacle. Let us give reverence. Worship God with all your strength and your whole being. In 2 Samuel 6: 20, we read about an absolute demonstration of how to worship God, by the example of King David. And he bragged about it. Can you and I do same? If we believe, we must change our attitude to worship.

2. We must yearn to receive Christ in his Most Holy Body and Blood. Do not joke about it. You do not choose whether or not you should go to Mass, or receive the Holy Communion. If you can place a premium on queueing for a visa, how much more the Food for the Journey? (see also 1 Cor. 11: 30).

3. Unity: Again from our 1st Reading, 1 Cor. 10: 17, we see clearly how the One Bread we take unites all of us. There is togetherness in the Communion we consume. We are united to Christ; and united with each other through his Body and Blood.
