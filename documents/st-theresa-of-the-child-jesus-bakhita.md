Thérèse of Lisieux, also known as “The Little Flower” was a Carmelite nun canonised in 1925 and declared a Doctor of the Church in 1997.

Born Marie Françoise-Thérèse Martin in France, her life was defined by her “Little Way”, a path to holiness through small, ordinary acts of love and humility. Although she died at the age of twenty-four from tuberculosis, her autobiography, “Story of a Soul” made her a hugely influential saint. A century after her canonisation, the Little Flower and her approach to holiness continues to inspire devotees around the world, and in Ghana.

#### The Society in Ghana

The St Theresa of the Child Jesus society takes inspiration from her life. It was established in Kumasi 1964 to bring Ghanaian Catholic women together for personal sanctification and missionary work. The society, founded by Dame Obaapanyin Gloria Peggy Kwasie, was introduced in Accra in March 1998 at the St Martin de Tours Catholic Church in Teshie.

The society in Accra began with 15 members and quickly grew to 90 by September 1998. The Accra chapter of the society marked its 25th anniversary in 2023 with celebrations of some of its achievements, including the dedication of the St Theresa of the Child Jesus Catholic Church in Gbetsile.

#### The Society at St Bakhita Parish

The society boasts a membership of ninety-nine persons, including sixty-three women. As part of its commitment to supporting the next generation of church leaders, it has provided material assistance to the seminarians from St Bakhita Parish. The society has occasionally supported two other seminarians from other Parishes.

Outside of this, the society has lent its support to initiatives within the archdiocese, such as at the Archbishop Kwofie Summer School Camp, where members volunteered to be teachers and chaperones. It has also provided meals for the youth every month during the washing of church vestments and linens. 

As part of its devotional practice, the society organises a monthly St Theresa of the Child Jesus novena at the church premises. It also lends support to its members and non-members during times of personal difficulty, emphasising its charitable mission in line with the values of St Thérèse of Lisieux.
