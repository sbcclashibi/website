31ST SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR A
Theme: Our Priests

#### 1st Reading: Malachi, chapter 1: 14b, to chapter 2: 2b, 8 - 10

Malachi expresses dismay at the way the priests of his time neglected their duty. We see a clear picture of the human frailty, to which priests could be disposed. Our part in ensuring the restoration of priestly values is to pray for our priests.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Thessalonians, chapter 2: 7b - 9, 13

This scripture stresses the need for the lay faithful to look up to our priests with the eyes of faith, and accept their teaching as words from God.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 23: 1 - 12

To avoid the situation where leaders imposed their own interpretation of the scriptures on their followers, and, consequently, followers putting misplaced trust in such leaders, Jesus is advocating for a return to the basic concept of God as the only true Teacher and Father.
