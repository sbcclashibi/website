# 6TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR A
Theme: Law and freedom

--- 

#### 1st Reading: Sirach, chapter 15: 15-20

God has given us the freedom of choice. All the same, he makes us aware of the preferred options which can only lead to salvation and not to condemnation.

#### 2nd Reading: The first letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 2: 6-10

St. Paul lifts the veil off what is generally accepted as wisdom; we are to know that although the wisdom of God is beyond our understanding, it is accessible to those who seek him.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 5: 17 – 37

Jesus Christ cautions against creating ambiguities by way of superficial interpretation of the commandments to serve our narrow interests. We must be firm in our “Yes” or in our “No”.
