# 4TH SUNDAY OF ADVENT, YEAR C
Theme: Faith and obedience of Mary to be followed 

---

#### 1st Reading Micah, chapter 5:1-4a

The prophecy of Micah traces the origin of the Messiah from an eternal source, through his birth in Bethlehem, to his reign of peace on earth.

#### 2nd Reading Hebrews, chapter 10:5-10

Jesus replaced the early sacrifice, the sacrifice of animals, with the sacrifice of his own body, a sacrifice that is pleasing to God. This was done according to God’s will, which our Lord came to fulfill.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 1:39-45

Mary’s focus and commitment to the goal of bearing the Messiah earned her the title “Blessed.” If we also trust that the Lord’s words to us, especially about the coming of the Saviour would be fulfilled, then we also shall be blessed.
