From the Book of the prophet Isaiah, 6:8, we read: “And I heard the voice of the Lord, say: “Whom shall I send?” and, “Who will go for us?” And I said: “Here I am. Send me.”

Today’s Gospel Reading, from Matthew 9: 36-10:8 is about a movement; a mission that we can learn from.

**Jesus saw (the crowd) with his eyes, and his heart was moved to pity.** Whatever is the predicament (of our neighbor) must attract not only our eyes, but our hearts as well. Jesus had compassion, ie, he “suffered with others.”

Other examples of Jesus showing compassion or being moved because of what was happening can be found in Mat. 20:34, Mat. 15: 32 and Luke 7: 11-13.

It looks like, rather sadly, empathy or fellow-feeling, has disappeared from our emotions. We prefer to bring out our phones and record what is happening than stretching out our hands to help a victim out of his predicament.

**Those we pity we must pray for.** The Shepherd (Christ), encouraged his sheep (his disciples), to pray to the Lord of the harvest for more labourers to be deployed to the field (Mat. 9:38).

Prayer alone may not go far; it is the hand of the Lord who governs the time for the sowing, and guides the nurturing process and determines the time for the harvest who should guide how we also carry out the various aspects of the mission he has called us to. Failure to entrust our efforts into his care may result in our enterprise being ill-timed or inappropriate, and, consequently, ineffective.

**Pity and prayer must propel mission.** Christ implored his disciples to pray to the Lord of the harvest. He didn’t stop there. Next, he called them to make a move; form his presence into the presence of the people, the field. In his presence, we are given authority to go out on mission.

God is always seeking to use us in various ways to reach out to his children. You might have heard him call you to a mission. Did you miss the call, or you simply ignored it? Were you irritated by the incessant call? Well, why not return the call and get enlisted and be empowered for the specific mission that the Lord is calling you to? Like Isaiah, it is time to say: “Here I am. Send me.”

**Mission is for impact; not for profiteering.** The authority that was given to the apostles to cast out demons, heal all manner of sicknesses etc was not meant for profit generation. Christ says in Mat. 10: 8 “You have received without pay, so give without being paid.”

The Apostles (The Twelve), were the new Israel (The Twelve Tribes). They were asked to go to the house of Israel, first. What this means is that we must take care of our immediate surroundings. Mission begins from our neighbourhood. Making money out of mission should not be our priority.

May God give us the zeal and commitment to do the work he has called us to.
