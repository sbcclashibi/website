Theme: The servant of Yahweh

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 42: 1-4, 6-7

This scripture outlines the mission of the Messiah. He is this servant of God who would restore justice to all the earth, and free us from the bondage of sin.

#### 2nd Reading: The Acts of the Apostles, chapter. 10: 34-38

St. Peter draws our attention to the fact that Jesus was anointed through baptism to fulfill his great mission. Our own baptism into the body of Christ should enable us to resolutely respond to our calling.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 3: 13-17

The Father’s declaration: “This is my beloved Son!....”  is a command to all baptized Christians to follow the Saviour, on whom God’s favour and Holy Spirit rest!
