# 5TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR A
Theme: Who are we?

---

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 58: 7-10

God demands that we practice charity and show compassion towards our neighbour. Our deep commitment to the well-being of all will thus be pleasing to God.

#### 2nd Reading: The first letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 2: 1-5

St. Paul writes that his mission to us is not to evangelise with sweet words nor with words of flattery, but to demonstrate that true faith is the power of God’s spirit. 

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 5: 13 – 16

Jesus uses the imagery of salt, and its power to season, and light, and its usefulness when it is well positioned, to throw a challenge to the faithful to make themselves relevant and valuable to the rest of mankind.
