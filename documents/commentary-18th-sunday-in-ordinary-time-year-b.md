# 18TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR B
Theme: the Lord gave them bread from heaven.

---

#### 1st Reading: Exodus, chapter 16: 2-4, 12-15

God led the Jews out of Egypt into freedom; but in their moment of hunger and despair, they craved for the days of slavery, when they could, at least, eat to their fill. God answered their petition, and fed them with manna from heaven. God has called us into his freedom, and will provide us with all our needs through the desert of life.

#### 2nd Reading: Ephesians, chapter 4: 17, 20-24

St Paul entreats us to live purposeful lives. We must change from our old and aimless goals. We must acquire a spiritual way of thinking, and live like people who have been created in the image of the Almighty God.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 6: 24-35

Jesus is the manna, the Bread of Life, which we need on our journey through life. If we come to him, we shall never be hungry; if we believe in him, we shall no longer be thirsty. Going to Jesus, and believing in him means having absolute confidence in him.
