Theme: Death and life

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 50: 4-7

This scripture describes the nature of the ideal servant of God. We hear how well-intentioned his thoughts are, and also how he humbly bears the suffering that sometimes goes with his nature.

#### 2nd Reading: Philippians, chapter 2: 6-11

St Paul entreats us to adopt Jesus’ attitude of humility, a character trait that earned him God’s approval and a name that is above all other names.
