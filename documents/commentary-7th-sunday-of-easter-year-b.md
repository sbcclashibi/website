# 7TH SUNDAY OF EASTER YEAR B
Theme: That all may be one.

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles, chapter 1:15-17, 20a, 20c-26

The apostles chose Matthias to replace Judas Iscariot, so that the work of the early church might continue without hindrance. They were united in prayer, and in supplication. This attitude of oneness of purpose remains a definite requirement for the success of our church in the present day.

#### 2nd Reading: 1st letter of John, chapter 4: 11-16

God loves us, so we must love one another. This mysterious spirit of love is the principle that underscores Christian unity. In other words, it is the love of God and love of neighbour that keeps us, and shall continue to keep the Christian community together.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 17: 11b-19

We read an excerpt from Jesusâ€™ prayer for his disciples, including those of us who follow him today. He prays that we should be united in love, as the Holy Trinity is united; and that we shall be protected from the evil one.
