# 2ND SUNDAY OF EASTER ( DIVINE MERCY SUNDAY)
Theme: Faith and fellowship.

---

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles chapter 4; 32-35

The focus of the early church was on togetherness. They shared every thing they had in common. For us today, the additional obligation is to take up the challenge of sharing our Christian values such as love, justice and mutual respect with everyone.

#### 2nd Reading: 1st letter of John, chapter 5: 1-6.

John writes that the children of God are those who believe that Jesus is the Christ, and, in addition, keep his commandments. The child of God conquers the world, and the power with which he achieves this is the power of faith.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 20: 19 -31

Jesus greets his disciples with the peace offering and breathed the empowering Holy Spirit on them. Thomas, who was absent when this happened, did not believe. Christ’s statement: “Blessed are they who have not seen and have believed,” underscores the importance of faith in the life of the Christian.
