# ALL SAINTS DAY
Theme: Our communion with the Saints

#### 1st Reading: Revelation, chapter 7: 2 - 4, 9 - 14

Scripture says that the saints, from Israel and the other nations of the world, were too numerous to be counted! The good news is that God has made it possible for us also to worship before his heavenly throne.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 John, chapter 3: 1 - 3

Followers of Christ, no doubt, go through times of peril. The soothing words of scripture assure us that like the saints, our hope of meeting our Maker will, indeed, become a reality.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 5: 1 – 12a

The Beatitudes or “Beautiful Attitudes” summarise the nature of Christ. The saints pursued these ideals. We, also, are expected to adopt same for our salvation.
