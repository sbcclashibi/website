Habakkuk complains to God about the wrongdoings which were prevalent in his day. Godâ€™s word to us this day is that his response to our lamentations will surely come, if only we have the faith to wait upon him.

#### 2nd Reading: 2 Timothy, chapter 1: 6-8, 13-14

Paul reminds us that God has placed his powerful Holy Spirit in us. He encourages us to hold firm onto, and jealously guard our faith, even in times of difficulties.

Jesus says that a little faith, which must, of necessity, be the right kind of faith, is all that we need. This kind of faith translates into the knowledge that it is a privilege to serve the Lord.
