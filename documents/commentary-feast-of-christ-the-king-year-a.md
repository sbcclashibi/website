# SOLEMNITY OF CHRIST, THE KING
Theme: The leadership of our Lord

---

#### 1st Reading: Ezekiel, chapter 34. 11 - 12, 15 - 17

God promises to look after us, and indeed care for us the way a shepherd tends his sheep. This means that our Lord is a king with a difference: a shepherd king, who is prepared to go all out to bring us salvation.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians chapter 15: 20 - 26, 28

St Paul explains that for now Jesus, the resurrected Christ, reigns as king, until all evil is defeated. At the end of time he will hand over his kingdom to God the father so that the redeemed can relate to God directly.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 25: 31 - 46

Jesus gives us some of the conditions for entering the kingdom of heaven: we are to love and care for our neighbours, including the deprived and the downtrodden. If we learn to live with Christ through our neighbour, we can live with him in his kingdom.
