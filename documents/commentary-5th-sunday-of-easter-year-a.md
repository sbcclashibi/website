# 5TH SUNDAY OF EASTER YEAR A 
Theme: Kairos – Time of favour

---

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles, chapter 6: 1- 7

The Apostles did not allow the material needs of the people to distract them from pressing on with the spiritual agenda. The message for us is that when we pursue Gospel values the Spirit of our Lord opens up ways and means for addressing our other needs.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Peter, chapter 2: 4 – 9

We understand from this scripture that we are inextricably linked to Jesus, the cornerstone. As the building blocks, we are enjoined to participate in the ministry of the Messiah.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 14: 1 – 12

Faith in Jesus is faith in God. This also means that we can open up to God through his Word to us, Jesus Christ. We must seize this God-given chance to take Jesus at his word.
