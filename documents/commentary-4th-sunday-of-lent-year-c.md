# 4TH SUNDAY OF LENT, YEAR C
Theme: God has reconciled himself to us through Christ

---

#### 1st Reading: Joshua, chapter 5: 9a, 10-12

The celebration of the Passover was a feast of thanksgiving. That manna ceased to fall meant that Godâ€™s people had to fend for themselves. Our Passover feast is the Eucharistic celebration, which is meant to strengthen us for our spiritual journey.

#### 2nd Reading: 2nd letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 5: 17-21

St Paul explains how God unconditionally reconciled us to himself. He commands us to spread the good news of reconciliation throughout the world.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 15: 1-3, 11-32

The Parable of the Prodigal Son, which could also be called the Parable of the Merciful Father, has lessons for all of us. Whether we squandered the opportunities God gave us, or served him in anticipation of rewards, we all need to return to him, and beg for pardon.
