# SOLEMNITY OF CHRIST, THE KING YEAR C
Theme: The God-given leadership of our Lord

---

#### 1st Reading: Second Book of Samuel, Chapter 5: 1 – 3

This scripture identifies the leader of God’s people as an “anointed king,” or a “Messiah.” In doing obeisance to David, the people acknowledge that his kingship is God-given.

#### 2nd Reading: Paul’s letter to the Colossians, Chapter 1: 12 – 20

Paul throws more light on who Christ is: he is the all in all for his followers, the beginning and the end of everything, and through whose blood we receive pardon for our sins.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, Chapter 23: 35 – 43

The kingship of Jesus, as seen through the paradox of cross, suffering and crown, means that his kingdom is beyond our understanding. He is the king who can forgive sins, even from his throne on the cross."
