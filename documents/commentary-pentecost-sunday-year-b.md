# PENTECOST SUNDAY  YEAR B                                     
Theme: The Spirit at work

---

#### 1st Reading: Acts of the Apostles, chapter 2: 1-11

On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended on the disciples, and they spoke in various tongues, even to the amazement of visitors who were present in Jerusalem that day. The Pentecost event means that the Christian message is meant for all people.
 
#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, chapter 12: 3b-7, 12-13.

Scripture makes it clear that the Holy Spirit gives different gifts to different people. No matter the way in which these gifts manifest, they are to be used for the good of the congregation.
 
#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 20: 19-23.

John’s account of the Pentecost is based on Jesus’ appearance in the midst of his disciples, soon after the resurrection. He breathed the Holy Spirit unto them, and empowered them to continue his work. Christ invites all of us this day, to receive his life-transforming Holy Spirit.
