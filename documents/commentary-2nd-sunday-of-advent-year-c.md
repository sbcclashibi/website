# 2ND SUNDAY OF ADVENT, YEAR C
Theme: All mankind shall see the salvation of God 

---

#### 1st Reading: Baruch, chapter 5:1-9

This scripture invites all who are downcast or gloomy to look up and enjoy the favours that God is pouring upon them.  For a people who were led into exile, the day to liberation is indeed a day of glory.

#### 2nd Reading: Philippians, chapter 1:4-6, 8-11

Paul is confident that the Lord, who has called us unto himself, will ensure that the mindset of good discipleship that he has implanted in us will remain intact till the end of time.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 3:1-6

The message of John the Baptist is straight to the point. Repentance calls for a complete change of attitude, so that we, the faithful, could position ourselves to welcome our Saviour.
