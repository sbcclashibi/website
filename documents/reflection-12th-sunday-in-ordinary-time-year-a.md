Read Jeremiah 20: 4 ff. Jeremiah was known by God when he was in the womb of his mother, yet he had cause, or occasion, to curse himself.
Also in Numbers 11:11 ff, Moses expressed similar sentiments as Jeremiah did. In Tobit 3:6, Tobit’s prayer was not different either. And these three were “serious men of God,” in Ghanaian parlance.

- Those who journey with God don’t wave white handkerchiefs all the time. Their lives are not endless celebrations.
- How many of us haven’t said these or words similar to what Jeremiah, Moses or Tobit said to God?
- A journey with God passes through various phases. It is not a smooth ride all the time. Sometimes, you know you have arrived, only to find out that there’s still a long way to go.
- Sometimes, you know you have not wronged anyone, but you can’t understand why things aren’t going well. It is so painful when you are innocent, yet you stand accused.
- But journeying with God means that at anytime, we may have to go through pain; the “pain phase” of the journey. What usually happens is that we wail, and lament, and rant. After ranting, we come back to rant even more.
- In Jeremiah 20: 11 we read about Jeremiah’s reassurance of faith in God. It is important that you add this kind of reassurance to your faith, else you may never want to pray again.  
- Because of his knowledge of God, Jeremiah uttered those words of faith. So it must be with you. 
- Reassure yourself of what God has done for you. Look back at what God has done for you. Look back at your past, and don’t doubt God. Look at your life, not as it is today, but how far the Lord has brought you.
- Sometimes, you wake up, full of hope; then the day ends on an unpleasant note. Be reminded about what the Lord tells us in the Gospel Reading: “Do not be afraid.” (Matt 10: 28). 
- However, it is not enough to reassure ourselves. When you say these words of reassurance, go to war in prayer. A critical situation requires critical prayer; an urgent matter requires urgent prayer.
- God is very unkind to those who are faithful to him. Scandalous, you might say. It’s true, isn’t it? What’s scandalous: the statement, or your perception of how God works?
- There’s the story of the fellow who went to heaven to seek out God. So he asks God: “Where were you when my family was suffering?” “Where were you when all these calamities were happening to me?” ”Where were you…..?”
- God’s reply: “I was at the same place when you were persecuting my Son (by your behavior/lifestyle)”
- Guess whose face fell. Guess who had the last laugh or the last smile!

You may have cause to rant, or to complain, or to lament. End your pain or misery with the lesson from Jeremiah 20: 13, and sing praises to God.
