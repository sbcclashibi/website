# 2ND SUNDAY OF LENT, YEAR C
Theme: In prayer, lift up your hearts to God

---

#### 1st Reading: Genesis, chapter 15: 5-12, 17-18

Abraham was in constant touch with God, through prayer. The lesson for us is to follow Abraham’s example of faith, even as we communicate with our God, so that we may experience his enduring presence.

#### 2nd Reading: Letter of Paul to the Philippians, chapter 3: 17 to chapter 4: 1

St Paul challenges us to follow his example of Christian discipleship. We should put a premium on things concerning our heavenly home, rather than be bogged down with matters of the flesh.

#### Gospel Reading: Luke, chapter 9: 28b-36 

We share the experiences of Peter, James and John in the Transfiguration event. God clearly identifies Jesus as his son and our Saviour. Children of God must listen to him.
