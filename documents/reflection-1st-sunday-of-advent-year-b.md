We have come to the beginning of another Liturgical Year. So, it’s Happy New year to us.

The Liturgical year begins with the 1st Sunday of Advent, which falls close to the end of the calendar year. There are four candles in the Advent Wreathe, and the first candle which is lighted for today’s Eucharistic celebration signifies Hope.

The Season of Advent has two focuses: first, Jesus’ coming to judge us, and, second, Jesus born for us, to save us. In Advent, we wait on he who watches over us (1st Reading). The Gospel Reading also entreats us to be on watch; to be on the alert.

Like our 1st Reading, Isaiah 64: 8-9 also recalls that we are clay, and God is the potter who made us. We are all the work of his hands. In this season of Advent, therefore we pray that God who created us will come and remake us. We have strayed, like the Israelites, but we are still hopeful.

In the first creation story, God spoke the word, and things came into existence. But when it came to man, he said: “Let us make man….” God took his time, calling others to join him in making man. God formed man from the earth/clay (Genesis 1:1-27).

Man was made just like a pot. God, here, is the potter. The potter takes great pains to mold a pot, and persists in his work until the pot turns out right (Jeremiah 18: 1-6). We are in God’s hands just like clay in the potter’s hands. We are, indeed, work in progress.

Let us now examine these truths:

- You are a masterpiece not on your own, but because of the one who made you; the one who is in you.

We are all masterpieces. Don’t belittle yourself any day. If no one sees your beauty, God sees it. Know that different values are placed on different things. Take, for example, a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. The painter is the reason why that painting is expensive. A faithful replica won’t fetch much because it is considered fake. If human beings can put such value on such things, how about you, made by God? Are you looking for a miracle? Don’t look far. Look in a mirror, and see yourself. 

The truth is you are in somebody’s hands: your own or someone else’s. You better be in a sure hand; God’s hand.

2 Corinthians 4:7 tells us that we who have this spiritual treasure are like clay pots, in order to show that the supreme power belongs to God, not us. We are such that we may be troubled, but not crushed; badly hurt at times, but not destroyed (2 Corinthians 4: 8-9). Clearly, we, who are earthen vessels have a value because of he who is in us: God! The Holy Spirit is in us, so we can’t be considered as being cheap. God doesn’t mind making his hands dirty just to make you.

- You are not a finished product in an instant.

Have you ever thought about what goes into the making of a pot? It is a long process, but the end product is beautiful. The potter crushes the clay, adds water to make it malleable, removes impurities such as stones, twigs and pieces of root from the clay and, patiently, kneads it to an acceptable consistency. Next he places it on the wheel, centers it and shapes it by turning, until the desired product is made. The potter may even end up making a cup instead of a pot. The choice is his!

That is what God does with us. He removes all impurities in us. Allow yourself to be molded. Abandon yourself to the skills of God, the Potter. The clay does not determine what it wants to be. Cooperate with God, and allow him to bring out the best in you. Let go, and let God.

- In molding, the pain brings the gain.

After molding, the pot is put out for drying. There is no visible work done on the pot at this stage. But with God, it is still preparation time for the furnace. This is a period of waiting. Don’t take it for granted. While waiting, God is still working. You can compare this waiting time with an arrow in a quiver. It is during this period that the arrow is oiled and sharpened for the D-Day.

The pot’s next schedule is firing in the furnace, to make it compact and useable. You will go through fire: persecution, disappointments, trials, pains etc. Different types of clay go through different temperature ranges. Different vessels have different temperature requirements. Don’t compare yourself with others. Your fire is good enough for you. It is meant to purify you so you won’t break. If you are going through something, someone may be going through worse things. Some may be smiling, but you don’t know the fire they are going through. It is our capacity to go through that will bring us the victory

You may complain that the meal you are served is too little. Someone hasn’t got anything to eat. Is your pay inadequate, and so you feel like quitting the job? Well, there is someone out there who has no job. Think about that. Read again 2 Corinthians 4: 1-8.

Be assured that when you go through fire, God is by your side.
