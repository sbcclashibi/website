We shall duel on four lessons that we learned from today’s homily.

#### 1. Do not prioritize your own work over God’s work, or the invitation from God.

Imagine you are the king, and you have given your subjects advance notice about the banquet. In fact, they are fully aware of the invitation. On the D-day, you ask your servants to call them to come and eat, drink and make merry. Just that: nothing more, nothing less. Yet they are full of excuses why they would not come to the banquet. So, if they would not come, why beat the servants up?

God invites us to worship him. To come to church. We also have several excuses; I woke up late; I do not drive at night; there is a pressing thing I have to do, etc.

There is the story of a boss who asked his workers to come to work, voluntarily, on a Saturday. He wanted to give them a surprise, and so he gave them notice well in advance, and a reminder close to the Saturday when he required them to come to work.

Only three turned up. The rest had “better things to do” on a Saturday. The boss actually had ten tickets for a fully-paid trip to Dubai. The three who turned up were given three tickets each; one for themselves, and the rest to be given to any two of their friends, excluding their coworkers who were absent from work that Saturday! 

We are not really different from the absentees.  On hearing about the treat the next working day, the rest of the workforce grumbled and demanded to know why they were not informed about what was going to happen. They all honoured the next invitation. That day, it was work, work and work; no party, no free tickets.

It looks like when God is giving us reminders, that is when we busy ourselves with thinking up excuses why we cannot come. We are reluctant to squeeze a little of our God-given time for his work, but are ever expectant that he would drop goodies into our laps.

Let us spend time with God. He has invited us to the banquet. Everything is ready. Our obligation is simple: only our presence is needed. 

#### 2. Be ready and be prepared at any time.
Fancy a person who is desperate for a job; he does not miss an opportunity to present or, as it were, pitch his joblessness to prospective employers. Now, when asked for his cv, well, it is at home, or hidden in a folder somewhere. The sanest thing to do is to have a soft copy on a storage device, for instant retrieval and submission. Simple! Is the fellow really ready for a job? Hmmm! Good question.

As a Christian you must be ready at all times. You cannot afford to waste time. You do not know when the Lord will call. Can you tell death to hold on and to come another day, because you are not ready?

Was the king in our Gospel Reading rude to the fellow who was improperly dressed? Of all you know, the king provided each guest with a garment for the banquet. It is likely the man did not think it was necessary to wear it. And we know how his chapter ended.

We all have been provided with garments in preparation for the feast. Take it, or leave it. Be prepared.

#### 3. Be part of the chosen few.
At the end of the Gospel Reading, Christ says: For many are called, but few are chosen (Matthew 22: 14). 

In school or in class are the many that are called to be students, to study diligently for the examinations. The many write the examinations, but only a few move further up to attain greater heights. These are the students whose persistence earns them the favour of being among the few who are chosen.

We are all called, but if Christ should come now, will we all go?

In our Second Reading, St. Paul has every kind words for the Philippians, saying that they were always there for him. We see that their acts of charity towards Paul were very much appreciated. This is as well a reminder to us that it pays to be among the few who are always there for people in the quality of help we offer them.

#### 4. Learn to adapt to situations.
For some of us, where there is happiness, there our soul is. We would not tolerate any unpleasant situations. In other words, unhappiness is not their portion. 

Paul has lessons for people with that kind of mindset. He has learnt to be contend with plenty and hunger, abundance and want (Philippians 4:12). He has seen it all, and has come out with flying colours, as we would put it. There is no reason to expect every day to be Christmas, with all the parties, and set aside Lent and Easter, and the fasting and penance that go with those seasons.

When things are okay, relish the good time. When things change, adapt and move on. You will find contentment in all manner of circumstances when you learn to adjust and adapt.

May this week present us with opportunities to live out every word that God tells us.
