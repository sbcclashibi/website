We know the five senses. These five senses are the window to our souls. Anytime we want to hear the voice of God, we must make sure that all the five senses are at work. How do we do it? Through silence.

Nowadays, we talk to God without pausing a bit to listen to his voice. The five foolish virgins asked their wise counterparts for oil because their lamps were going out. They refused to do so. Ordinarily, we would say that this was selfishness on the part of the five wise virgins. “Sharing is caring,” goes the adage. So we may want to know why sharing was not a good idea for the five wise virgins.

This story is a parable. We must understand that Jesus was not talking about actual oil, but about our relationship with God, and how we identify ourselves with God. If you cannot use your five senses to hear God, how can you expect someone else to use his/her five senses to hear God on your behalf? Or how do you expect someone to tell you how to use your five senses to hear God’s voice?

The relationship we have with God allows us to prepare ourselves to go to heaven. Without that kind of preparation and readiness, we cannot get to heaven. We relate to God, and to each other. It follows, therefore that the only persons that can take themselves to heaven are the persons themselves. In fact, God did not create us to impose himself on us. He created a unique relationship with us, and it is that unique relationship that helps us to enter the kingdom of heaven. To be able to enter into heaven, we have to be one with God.

We have heard it said many times: “Jesus is my personal saviour. What exactly do we mean by this statement? And when we are asked: “Is Jesus your personal saviour?” what is our response? Quite often, our response is to panic, like the five foolish virgins. If you panic upon hearing this question, it means you are not ready to enter the banquet of the bridegroom; or, to put it another way, you are not ready to enter the kingdom of heaven. 
 
Later in the Gospel Reading, the five foolish virgins came back after buying their oil. They knocked on the door, only to be told by the bridegroom: “I do not know you.” We can be coming to church, but if we are not prepared, the same response awaits us: “I do not know you.” It’s not about our clothes, hairdo or other adornments. It’s about Jesus affirming that he knows us well enough to give us entry into the eternal banquet.

The five foolish virgins carried with them a mindset of complacency and pride. They thought they could borrow their way out of their predicament. It did not happen.

Will you be ready if the Lord should come today? Will you tell him that you have fought the good fight, and have run the good race? And will the Lord accept you?

Sometimes, our pride puts us on the other side: the foolish side. Our actions, attitudes and attributes must all the times be that of Jesus. That is the only way we can be ready when the Lord comes.
