# A Brief History of St Bakhita Parish

#### I

The first chapter of the story of the fortunate church was written against the backdrop of the increasing numbers of the then parishioners of Corpus Christi Catholic Church, Sakumono, who lived in Lashibi and its immediate environs, particularly Communities 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20.

In 2003, the mother church, shepherded at the time by Rev. Fr. Fred Agyeman, in view of the overflowing numbers of parishioners within Lashibi and its environs, as well as its desire to attain the status of a Parish, saw the need to have some of those parishioners coordinate and organize the affairs of their communities. 

The representatives, Mrs. Victoria Ami Dzakpasu (who was responsible for Communities 16 and 17) as well as Mr. Emmanuel Khartey and Mrs. Matilda Patience Khartey (who were charged with Communities 18, 19, and 20) were made a part of the Corpus Christi Church Welfare Committee under the leadership of Mr. Emil Atta-Fynn. They were tasked with giving periodic reports on the viability of starting a church in the Lashibi environs. These reports were forwarded to the Parish Pastoral Council through the Welfare Committee. 

It is worthy of note that during this period, a group of Catholics within the Lashibi environs used to meet and pray the Rosary in one of the classrooms of the Corpus Christi Basic School at Community 18. These individuals and families included, but were not limited to, Mr. and Mrs. Francis Baffoe, Mr. George Arthur and family, Mrs. Elizabeth Tapang-Tettey and family, Prof. Daniel and Mrs. Rosaline B. Obeng-Ofori and family, and Mrs. Vida Domelevo. These persons who at the time also shared a common desire to bring together the Catholics within the Lashibi area made some effort towards this end.

Ash Wednesday, February 25, 2004, marked an important milestone for the church. The very first Mass for Catholics within Lashibi and its environs was held at Corpus Christi Basic School. This marked the beginning of weekday masses which were held on Wednesdays and Fridays at the school. These were sustained with the support and coorperation of the management of the school, then led by Rev. Sis. Beatrice Gbedemah.

On November 10, 2004, about nine months after the first mass was held, the first interim Church Councillors were nominated and installed by Rev Fr. Richard Yaovi Aziati, the then Assistant Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Catholic Church. With perseverance and by the grace of God, the evening Masses which hitherto recorded low numbers gradually picked up. The first Councillors were:

To promote the growth, unity and connectedness of the newly-formed community, the interim Council advocated for programs to be held in the new community, to help set it apart from Corpus Christi. The first Eucharistic Sunday Celebration was held on the first Sunday of Lent in 2005 - February 14, 2005 - with Rev. Fr. Fred Agyeman as the celebrant. There were over 400 faithful in attendance.

The interim Church Council met every Wednesday and Friday evening after Mass in order to prepare for Sunday Mass. This led to the formation of the Day Groups in June, 2005, a concept adopted from the mother church. The Day Group concept still serves as the pivot around which the church organizes all its activities.

The new community, in recognition of the importance of moulding its youngest members - the future of the church - commenced Sunday School with 50 children on April 3, 2005. Catechism classes also started on 1st July, 2005 with 20 catechumens.

On Saturday October 8, 2005 Corpus Christi Catholic Church was declared a full Parish with an outstation, St. Bakhita Church (nicknamed “the fortunate one”) by His Grace Archbishop Charles Gabriel Palmer-Buckle. Today, that little outstation boasts of a strength of over 1000 adult members and children.

With time, the Church began to grow in all facets; societies and ministries started to gain root in the community. In 2008, the first Father and Mother of the Year, in the persons of Mr. Emmanuel Adjetey Khartey and Mrs. Gladys Senoo respectively, were chosen and recognized.

On May 5, 2007 the sod was cut for the construction of the edifice presently occupied, with a seating capacity of about 2,500. The biblical quotation chosen for the sod-cutting ceremony was taken from 2 Chronicles 2:4 - “The house I am building will be large, for our God is greater than all gods.” Today, the prophecy has been fulfilled. In November 2011, to the glory of God, St. Bakhita Catholic Church moved from the Corpus Christi Basic School to its present location. 

On December 8, 2018, the Church dedicated its grotto, a project financed by a member family.

The church chose as its slogan, “St Bakhita – the fortunate one; the fortunate ones, we shall build our Church”, inspired by its patron saint's name, which means "lucky", or "fortunate" in Arabic. With time, the response to the call of the slogan was changed to "We are building our church".

In 2019, the Church was officially licensed and gazetted to host the celebration of marriages. On October 5, 2019, the first wedding was celebrated in the Church.

On February 8, 2020, the Church celebrated its fifteenth anniversary. It was dedicated by the Archbishop of Accra, His Grace John Bonaventure Kwofie, at a mass witnessed by thousands. A number of programmes and activities were organized, including its very first mass wedding, which was held on February 8, 2020.

Among other milestones, the church is proud to be the first outstation of Corpus Christi Catholic Church. It is also grateful to have been associated with priests such as Rev. Frs. Fred Agyeman, Richard Yaovi Aziati, Francis Destiny Amenuvor, Joseph Henry Mensah, Philip Bempong, Emmanuel Gosu and Januarius Akpabli.

The church, which was hitherto an outstation of Corpus Christi, was elevated to the status of a rectorate on September 4, 2019. This came after a forum with His Grace John Bonaventure Kwofie on Saturday, June 22, 2019, during which a plea was made for the appointment of a dedicated priest for the fast-growing church.

Rev. Fr. Hillary Agbenosi was appointed as the first Rector of the newly established Rectorate, on October 1, 2019.

Since the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic and partial lockdowns that affected Accra, the church has consistently produced content for online consumption, including daily live streams of masses and other church services and events, as well as a podcast of homilies given at the church.

On 19th April 2023, Bishop John Kobina Louis was consecrated as an auxilliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Accra. He took up residence at St Bakhita, while maintaining an office at Corpus Christi Parish. St Bakhita was elevated to a parish on 11th February 2024 in a grand ceremony that was celebrated by His Grace John Bonaventure Kwofie.

On 24th August 2024, 16 deacons of the Archdiocese of Accra were ordained as priests of the Accra Archdiocese at the newly elevated parish. The mass was presided over by His Eminence Cardinal Peter Turkson, chancellor of the Pontifical Academies of Sciences.

On 1st December 2024, the 1st Sunday of Advent, the first mass at St Bakhita Parish's first outstation at Klagon was celebrated by Rev Fr Hillary Agbenosi. The mass was attended by parishioners from St Bakhita and catholic faithful from Klagon and its environs. The church has since been named "Epiphany Catholic Church" by the Archbishop of Accra.

After the Accra Archdiocesan ordinations of 2025, Rev Fr Victor Ampim joined the parish as its second Assistant Parish Priest in September.
