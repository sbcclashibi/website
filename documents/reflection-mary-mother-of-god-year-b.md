The Church has given us this day, the Solemnity of Mary, the Mother of God, to begin the new year. We celebrate this woman, the Mother of God. If she is the Mother of God, make her your mother this year, and she will journey with you and bless you throughout the year. Here are a few ways we stand to reap great rewards when we welcome Mary, the Mother of God into our lives:

**You will gain wisdom.** Mary is the Seat of Wisdom. The Mother of Jesus encountered wisdom while she carried the baby Jesus in her womb. She intercedes for us to gain wisdom. Go to her. Own her. Tell her you need wisdom, and she will intercede for you to gain the wisdom you ask for.  We know from scripture that she is the only woman who is highly favoured. She is full of grace. We definitely need favour to get access to anything, and this favour rest upon her.

**You will receive numerous/countless blessings.** You are looking for a breakthrough? Turn to Mary. She was blessed to give birth to the Messiah. Personalize her, and the blessings shall come upon you. This was the woman who brought blessings to the home of Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist. (Read about the Mary’s visit to her cousin, Elizabeth in Luke 1: 39-56).

**She will teach you how to humble yourself.** Mary is the epitome of humility. She gave birth to Wisdom; the Messiash, who is the Word incarnate. This was a great achievement. All the same, and in spite of several other accolades, Mary remained humble.

**Mary will teach you how to go through suffering.** It was said of her that a sword would pierce her heart. This meant that she would experience distressing moments/periods. In all these, she endured. You will learn endurance from Mother Mary. If you welcome her into your home, she will teach you how to overcome.

**Mary will teach you how to love unconditionally.** Jesus and those around him, no doubt, experienced the love Mary offered. During the wedding feast at Canaan, Mary’s intercession saved the day for the groom and the bride. Playing the role of intercessor is something that comes naturally to Mary, a role she would gladly play for her any of her children who are in need.

There are other testimonies about how Mary showed her love for those who seek her assistance. Our prayer is that your testimony about what Mary’s intercession has done in your live, shall also be narrated among several others.

So, my brothers and sisters, invite Mary into your home and into your life this year. Her intercession will bring a significant turnaround to your life.
