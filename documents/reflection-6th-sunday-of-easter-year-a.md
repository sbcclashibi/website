_From the Homily of Fr Evans Halolo_

Today is Mothers’ Day. We all have kind words for our moms. Even though we may not think of it, these kind words are borne out of the virtues that our mothers have infused into us when we were being nurtured by them.

God, in his infinite wisdom, has infused into us three virtues which are known as the three theological virtues, ie faith, hope and love.

**Faith:** Knowing that whether rain or shine, we can trust God to deliver. Our situation may be as dire as the worst thing that could happen to us, including taunting by those who make discouraging remarks about our faith. The bottom line is that we have to have enough faith to see us through the circumstances. Suffering should never be used as a tool to discredit God.

**Hope:** Putting your trust in God. The early disciples, no doubt, faced many challenges. They could hardly be heard in Jerusalem because of persecution. After the martyrdom of Stephen, all hope was lost. They lost steam. By divine intervention, Phillip and his colleagues, as we read in the 2nd Reading, took the Gospel to Samaria, hitherto considered as enemy territory. How did they do it? Their hope of conquering was founded on God. God tore down the barrier between the Jews and the Samaritans.

**Love:** St. John of the Cross said: “In the evening of life, we will be judged on love alone.” We love whom we have come to believe. Love God, no matter what; whether you are disobedient or play the truant. Love God as he loves you. Make progress in your love for God, and he’ll send you the Paraclete, the Advocate. Besides, Jesus commands us to love God.

Pray the Creed meditatively.
