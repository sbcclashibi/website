Today, we are looking at forgiveness.

It is not easy to forgive. In other words, forgiveness is a difficult task. You might have been offended. Sometimes, it is very painful, yet God says you must forgive.

There are three types of forgiveness:

**Exoneration**: The offender may not know he has offended you. The person may come and apologise, and make a conscious effort not to do that again. Forgive him.

**Forbearance**: They will offend you, but will put the blame on you, and say that you are the cause of what happened. Forgive him, and move on, because you might have contributed to the conflict.

**Release**: When the offender will not even come and apologise, though he may know he has offended you. In Release, you want your peace of mind, so you let go, and move on.

#### Why should we forgive?

i. God forgives, so we also have to do so. Count the number of times you have offended God; and the number of times you resolved to mend your ways, never really got to do so.

ii. We offend people day in and day out; yet we want them to forgive us. So, forgive; it is a requirement from God.

#### How can we forgive?

i.Through prayers: It is not very easy. You see the offender every day, and the sight of him may be simply unbearable. Therefore, pray about it, because you need strength from God. Remember that Jesus Christ asked us to pray for our enemies. Pray for yourself as well.

ii. Communicate with the person who offended you. Let the person know he has wronged you. Discuss the issue with him, so you will be able to make peace with him.

iii. Involve others. There are times when you have to involve others in order to resolve differences. In last week’s Gospel Reading, Jesus outlined how conflict among brethren are to be resolved (Matthew 18: 16). You may have to do so if that would help.

#### Consequences of unforgiveness

i. Health-related issues: Stress, anxiety and fears are the baggage that you become burdened with. You find yourself always moody, because you are angry and are not ready to forgive.

ii. Division: Unforgiveness bring division among families, friends, colleagues at the workplace etc; these relationships suffer.

iii. You are imprisoned in the past, because you simply cannot break from your past. You don’t want to open up and relate to others. This can affect your outlook on life.

iv. If you don’t forgive, you won’t get forgiveness from God either. When it comes to the crunch when you badly need forgiveness, you will find out, regrettably, that no one would be willing to forgive you; just like the servant in the Gospel Reading whose debt was forgiven, but would not forgive his fellow servant the paltry sum he owed him. In fact, you will be reminded about your several instances of unforgiveness. 

#### Benefits of forgiveness: 

i. Forgiveness brings unity and reconciliation. See the joy that it brings! Just like the joy that comes when you are absolved from sin at Confession. Your mood changes. Your countenance lightens up.

ii. You gain forgiveness from God. (see 1st Reading and the Gospel Reading). A person who forgives will have others plead on his behalf; not so the unforgiving person.

Today is a Forgiving Sunday. You are probably facing a challenge or there is a burden on you that isn’t making you forgive that person who offended you. Today is the day to take the step towards reconciliation. Pray to God to grant you the strength to forgive “not seven times, but seventy times seven” (Matthew 18; 22).
