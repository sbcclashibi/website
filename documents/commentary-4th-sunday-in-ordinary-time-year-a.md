# 4TH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME YEAR A
Theme: Humility

---

#### 1st Reading: Zephaniah, chapter 2: 3, and chapter 3: 12 – 13

We can avert God’s punishment if we humble ourselves. God says that he will place among us people who are humble; whose lives will be an example of his expectations of us.

#### 2nd Reading: The first letter of Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 1: 26 – 31

God does not place his divine value on our human treasures. If there is anything that we must boast of, then it must be that special relationship we have with him through Christ Jesus.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 5: 1 – 12

The Beatitudes or “The Beautiful Attitudes” summarise the nature or attributes of Christ, which we are expected to emulate. This new teaching is grounded in God’s expectation of humility from us.
