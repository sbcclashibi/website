Theme: Be watchful!

#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 2: 1 – 5

Isaiah’s vision of the world to come in the wake of the Messiah’s advent is a world of peace and love, as well as a yearning for the knowledge of God and his word.

#### 2nd Reading: Paul’s letter to the Romans, chapter 13: 11 – 14

Paul reminds us of the rapidly approaching day of salvation. This is the best time for us to shed the clothes of base desires, and embrace all that Jesus stands for.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 24: 37 – 44

Jesus uses the element of surprise to compare his second coming to the flood in the days of Noah; people were taken unawares. The message for us is that we must be prepared.
