#### 1st Reading: Isaiah, chapter 56: 1, 6 - 7

God does not discriminate against anyone. His justice and salvation are available to all; the common measure being obedience to his laws.

#### 2nd Reading: Romans, chapter 11: 13 - 15, 29 - 32

Paul hopes that his mission to the Gentiles would prompt his fellow Jews to heed the message of the gospel. Another way to look at this scripture is that both Jews and Gentiles receive God’s blessings because of commission or omission by either part.

#### Gospel Reading: Matthew, chapter 15: 21 - 28

Jesus’ seeming reluctance to grant the Canaanite woman’s request, and the latter’s persistence teaches that God rewards faith, irrespective of status or background.
