Question: What are we taking home today? If you were asked what you heard at Mass today, what would your answer be?

The First Reading and the Gospel Reading speak about seed: good seed and good harvest. The seed is good, but it is where it falls that will determine how much fruit it will bear. 

You may wonder why some bear fruit, while others do not.

Let us touch on some lessons:

- i. It is **fear**; they are afraid of several things such as family, friends and colleagues. They think more of what others would say about them, especially when their efforts result in failure. The flip side of this is that when you succeed you would be applauded. So why do you bow to fear? Do not let fear kill your goal.

- ii. **Pride**: Pride is when we are not prepared to learn. We are so fixated on our convictions that our posturing does not allow us to bear fruit. Will asking for a helping hand diminish or crush your ego? The cure for pride is humility. We have to learn from the farmer who humbly waits for the seed to grow, blossom and bear fruit. Discard pride and bear fruit. In other words, do not let pride kill your goal. 

- iii. Often times, we do not bear fruit because **we do not have good role models**. Ask yourself: If Jesus is not my role model, what business do I have to call myself a Christian? Remember that the Lord is the ultimate role model for all of us who are his followers. The Good Book gives us several examples of role models: Mary who was always there for her son and for us; St. joseph who is model for caring fathers; the list goes on and on. Even in contemporary life, there is no shortage of role models. Do not be influenced by what is trending on social media, for instance, to push yourself into the hands of the wrong role models. A good role model will direct you onto the right path, so you can attain your goal.

- iv. **Have a waiting spirit**.  Again let us turn our focus to the farmer: he sows the seed, weeds the farm, waters the crops, and waits patiently for the plant to bear fruit. He waits from Day 1 through to Day2, Day 3, and on and on. He does not jump from Day 1 to, say, Day 10. Waiting patiently is the only way we can see our efforts bear fruit.

- v. **Pray daily**. Prayer works! The good news is that prayer works! Whatever you ask of the Lord, he will do it. He works in mysterious ways. Prayer will make us land on good soil so we can bear good fruit. Remember that you are a good seed.

From the Gospel Reading, we can infer that the four types of soil on which the seed or God’s word falls describe four types of Christian attitudes. The parable of the Sower, therefore, poses the question: “To which type of soil do you, as a believer, belong?”
