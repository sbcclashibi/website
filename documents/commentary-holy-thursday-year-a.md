Theme: Love one another

---

#### 1st Reading: Exodus, chapter 12: 1 – 8, 11 – 14

God instituted the Passover Feast as a memorial to celebrate the freedom from slavery of his people. Christians today acknowledge the event as the antecedent to our deliverance from sin by the blood of Jesus.

#### 2nd Reading: 1 Corinthians, chapter 11: 23 – 26

The Eucharistic celebration enables the faithful to join hands with our ancestors in the faith to celebrate our redemption from sin.

#### Gospel Reading: John, chapter 13: 1 – 15

Jesus, the Lord, washed the feet of his disciples, and charged them to do the same. This action is to prove the point that we must love and serve one another.
