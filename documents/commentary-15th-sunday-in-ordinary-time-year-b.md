#### 1st Reading: Amos, chapter 7: 12-15

The disagreement between Amaziah, priest of Bethel, and Amos the preacher from Judah, shows that there could be contrasting styles of presenting the Good News to Godâ€™s people. Notwithstanding how we perceive these methods, the situation calls for mutual respect and fraternal love.

#### 2nd Reading: Ephesians, chapter 1:3-14

St. Paul urges us to constantly praise God, our Creator, for making us his own. We should also be grateful that God has been generous enough to let us understand his plans for us.

#### Gospel Reading: Mark, chapter 6:7-13

Jesus sent his disciples out, to spread the Gospel, and also to drive out evil spirits. His parting words to the disciples suggest that not everyone would accept the Good News.
